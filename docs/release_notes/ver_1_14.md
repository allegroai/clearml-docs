### ClearML Server 1.14.1

**Bug Fixes**
* Fix created pipelines do not appear in the UI pipelines section

### ClearML SDK 1.14.0
**New Features and Improvements**
* Add support for decorated pipeline steps [ClearML GitHub issue #1154](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/1154)
* Improve `torch.distributed` behavior and auto-detect Huggingface accelerate distributed execution
* Improve `jsonargparse` integration: `allow_config_file_override_from_ui` argument added for enabling/disabling 
overriding configuration file entries
* Add `raise_on_error` parameter to `Model.update_weights()` and `Model.update_weights_package()`
* Add HPO multi-objective optimization support by specifying multiple optimization objectives to the HyperParameterOptimizer class
* Improve pipelines from functions: libraries used by pipeline steps no longer have to be imported in the step itself 
and can be imported globally instead
* Support clearing repository details in `Task.set_repo()`
* Auto-detect `tensorflow-intel` as `tensorflow`
* Add support for auto-detecting `torch` and transformers `accelerate` distributed execution
* Add tabular data multi-stage pipeline process example

**Bug Fixes**
* Fix `langchain` integration [ClearML GitHub issues #1124](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/1124) and [ClearML GitHub issue #1126](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/1126)
* Fix using `target_project` with `TaskScheduler.add_task()` corrupts project if used with pipelines [ClearML GitHub issue #1137](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/1137)
* Fix `PipelineController.add_function_step()` fails when adding custom decorated step [ClearML GitHub issue #1154](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/1154)
* Fix `jsonargparse` binding does not capture parameters before `Task.init()` is called [ClearML GitHub issue #1164](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/1164)
* Fix invalid `jsonargparse` arguments should be deleted
* Fix handling of appended parameters to Hydra defaults list
* Fix `Task.set_repo()` and `Task.set_packages()` do not wait for automatic asynchronous repository detection
* Fix active GPU filtering in resource monitor to support GPU ID and not just GPU idx
* Fix misleading error raised when using the SDK with no configuration file or an invalid configuration file
* Fix process sometimes hangs issue by improving exit and exception handlers, unregistering signal handling in child 
processes except for the `BackgroundMonitor`

### ClearML Server 1.14.0

**New Features and Improvements** 
* New UI experiment table comparative view: compare plots and scalars of all selected experiments
* Add UI experiment display of original python requirements along with actual packages used [ClearML GitHub issue #793](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/793)
* Add UI project metric snapshot support for multiple metrics
* Add compressed UI experiment table info panel mode displaying only experiment name and status
* Add "x unified" hover mode to UI plots
* Add experiment hyperparameter UI section dataset IDs link to datasets page
* Make all URLs clickable in UI experiment artifacts
* Redesign WebApp tabs: tabs now appear in UI header
* Add option to force setting original task as clone's parent when cloning a task

**Bug Fixes**
* Fix CVE-2023-45133 Web App vulnerability
* Fix "select all" in UI dataset archive displays count of all archived and unarchived experiments
* Fix hyperparameter keys with dots in their names displayed incorrectly in UI experiment table and task info
* Fix UI experiment scalar comparison raising error
* Fix "Project" column redundantly appears inside a specific project's model table
* Fix UI models with many labels slowing down web app
* Fix simple UI plots (scatter, bar, etc.) in experiment comparisons not merging by experiment
* Fix UI pipeline details panel does not display information
* Fix UI plot "Show/hide" legend button sometimes disappears
* Fix can't select root project in UI report creation modal when workspace has no projects 
* Fix "load more" button displayed unnecessarily in UI object tables
* Fix archive action in UI dataset table archives unselected datasets
