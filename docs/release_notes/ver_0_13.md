## Version 0.13.3

### Trains

**Features and Bug Fixes**

* Add a binding for `tensorboard.summarywriter.addscalars`
* Add the `tensorboard_single_series_per_graph` method, which supports separate plots for each TensorBoard scalar.
* Add the `Task.set_base_docker` and `Task.get_base_docker` methods for the base Docker image used by **Trains Agent**.
* Add support for the standard OS environment variables to obtain default credentials for:
  * AWS: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`.
  * Azure Storage: `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` and `AZURE_STORAGE_KEY`.
  * Google Cloud Storage: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.
    
* Add the `Task.get_parameters_as_dict` and `Task.set_parameters_as_dict` methods supporting get / set of parameters from referenced Tasks (use the `Task.get_task` to get a reference).
* Make sure `Task.connect` always returns the connected instance passed to it.
* `tensorflow_gpu` takes precedence over `tensorflow` when Trains detects installed packages to record experiment dependencies.
* Remove title and series naming restrictions (allow `$` and `.`) when reporting metrics.
* Fix incorrect printouts in initialization wizard and upgrade notifications.
* Fix debug images URL for uploaded files with `%` in their name.

### Trains Agent

**Features and Bug Fixes**

* Allow providing queue names instead of queue IDs in daemon mode.
* Improve Docker mode:
    * Support running as a specific user inside a docker using the `TRAINS_AGENT_EXEC_USER` environment flag.
    * Pass the correct GPU limit when skipping gpus flag.
    * Add the `--force-current-version` daemon command-line flag.
* Add K8s/trains glue service example.
* Add K8s support in daemon mode.
    * Running inside a K8s pod.
    * Mounting dockerized experiment folders to host.
    * Allow a specific network for the docker.
* Add default storage environment vars (for AWS, GS and Azure) to generated agent configuration.
* Improve Unicode/UTF stdout handling.

## Version 0.13.2

### Trains

**Features and Bug Fixes**

  using the `Logger.report_image.params.url` parameter.
* Add support for Git repositories without a `.git` suffix, for example Azure Repos.
* Improve conda support.
* Improve hyperparameters [argparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) integration.
