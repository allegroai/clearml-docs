### Trains Agent 0.16.2

**Features**

- conda:

    - Add `agent.package_manager.conda_env_as_base_docker` allowing "docker_cmd" to contain link to a full pre-packaged conda environment (`tar.gz` created by `conda-pack`). Use `TRAINS_CONDA_ENV_PACKAGE` environment variable to specify `conda tar.gz` file.
    - Add conda support for read-only pre-built environment (pass conda folder as `docker_cmd` on Task).
    - Improve trying to find conda executable.

- k8s glue:

    - Add support for limited number of services exposing ports.
    - Add support for k8s pod custom user properties.
    - Allow selecting external `trains.conf` file for the pod itself.
    - Allow providing pod template, extra bash init script, alternate SSH server port, gateway address (k8s ingress / ELB).

- Allow specifying `cudatoolkit` version in the "installed packages" section when using conda as package manager (<a href="https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/229" target="_blank">GitHub trains Issue 229</a>).
- Add `agent.package_manager.force_repo_requirements_txt`. If True, "Installed Packages" on Task are ignored, and only repository `requirements.txt` is used.
- Pass `TRAINS_DOCKER_IMAGE` into docker for interactive sessions.
- Add `torchcsprng` and `torchtext` to PyTorch resolving.

**Bug Fixes**

- When logging suppress "\r" when reading a current chunk of a file / stream. Add `agent.suppress_carriage_return` (default True) to support previous behavior.
- Make sure `TRAINS_AGENT_K8S_HOST_MOUNT` is used only once per mount.
- Fix k8s glue script to trains-agent default docker script.
- Fix apply git diff from submodule only.
- conda:
    - Fix conda pip freeze to be consistent with trains 0.16.3.
    - Fix conda environment support for trains 0.16.3 full env. Add `agent.package_manager.conda_full_env_update` to allow conda to update back the requirements (default False, to preserve previous behavior).
    - Fix running from conda environment - `conda.sh` not found in first conda PATH match.
  
- Fix docker mode ubuntu / debian support by making sure not to ask for input (fix `tzdata` install).
- Fix repository detection - ignore environment `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, only check if git user/pass are configured.
- git diff:
  - Fix support for non-ascii diff.
  - Fix diff with empty line at the end will cause corrupt diff apply message.
  - Allow zero context diffs (useful when blind patching repository).
- Fix `daemon --stop` when agent UID cannot be located.
- Fix nvidia docker support on some linux distros (SUSE).
- Fix nvidia pytorch dockers support.
- Fix torch CUDA 11.1 support.
- Fix requirements dict with null entry in `pip` should be considered None install from repository's `requirements.txt`.

### Trains Agent 0.16.1

**Features**

* Add `sdk.metrics.plot_max_num_digits` configuration option to reduce plot storage size.
* Add `agent.package_manager.post_packages` and `agent.package_manager.post_optional_packages` configuration options to control packages install order (e.g. horovod).
* Add `agent.git_host` configuration option for limiting git credential usage for a specific host (overridable using `TRAINS_AGENT_GIT_HOST` environment variable).
* Add `agent.force_git_ssh_port` configuration option to control HTTPS to SSH link conversion for non-standard SSH ports.
* Add requirements detection features. Improve support for detecting new pip version (20+) supporting `package @ scheme://link`.

**Bug Fixes**

* Fix pre-installed packages are ignored when installing a git package wheel. Reinstalling a `git+http` link is enough 
  to make sure all requirements are met / installed  ([GitHub Issue #196](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/196)).
* Fix incorrect check for spaces in current execution folder.
* Fix requirements detection:
    * Update torch version after using downloaded / system pre-installed version.
    * Do not install git packages twice when a new pip version is used (pip freeze will detect the correct git link version).

### Trains Agent 0.16.0

**Features**
* Add `agent.docker_init_bash_script` configuration section to allow finer control over Docker startup script.
* Changed default Docker image from `nvidia/cuda` to `nvidia/cuda:10.1-runtime-ubuntu18.04` to support `cudnn` frameworks (e.g. TF).
* Improve support for Dockers with preinstalled `conda` environment.
* Improve trains-agent-docker spinning.
* Add `daemon --order-fairness` for round-robin queue pulling.
* Add `daemon --stop` to terminate a running agent (assuming other arguments are the same). If no additional arguments, Agents are terminated in lexicographical order.
* Support cleanup of all log files on termination unless executed with `--debug`.
* Add error message when Trains API Server is not accessible on startup.

**Bug Fixes**

* Fix GPU Windows monitoring support ([GitHub Issue #177](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/177)).
* Fix `.git-credentials` and `.gitconfig` mapping into docker.
* Fix non-root docker image usage.
* Fix docker to use `UTF-8` encoding, so prints won't break it.
* Fix `--debug` to set all loggers to `DEBUG`.
* Fix task status change to `queued` should never happen during Task runtime.
* Fix `requirement_parser` to support `package @ git+http` lines.
* Fix GIT user/password in requirements and support for `-e git+http` lines.
* Fix configuration wizard to generate `trains.conf` matching latest Trains definitions.
