### ClearML Agent 1.8.0

**New Features**
* Add `CLEARML_AGENT_FORCE_POETRY` environment variable to allow forcing poetry even when using pip requirements manager
* Add `CLEARML_AGENT_FORCE_TASK_INIT` environment variable to allow runtime patching of script even if no repository is

  * Add `FileLock` readonly mode, default is write mode (i.e. exclusive lock, preserving behavior)
  * Add venv cache now uses readonly lock when copying folders from venv cache into target folder. This enables multiple read, single write operation
