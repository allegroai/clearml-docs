### Enterprise Server 3.23.1

**Bug Fixes**
* Fix UI Orchestration's Workers and Queues tabs do not update in real time when auto-refresh is enabled

### Enterprise Server 3.23.0

**Default Behavior Change for Object Access (Access Rules)**
* Users can only access objects as explicitly specified by the access rules applied to them. If users can no longer 
access objects (Projects, Tasks, Datasets etc.) they had previously created, verify access rules exist that provide the 
user access to these objects or their containing project.

**New Features**
* New ClearML Model dashboard: View all live model endpoints in a single location, complete with real time metrics reporting.
* New UI pipeline run table comparative view: compare plots and scalars of selected pipeline runs
* New UI setting for configuring cloud storage credentials with which ClearML can clean up cloud storage artifacts on task deletion. 
* Add UI re-enqueue of failed tasks
* Add configuration vaults for service accounts 
* Add administrator vaults for UI storage credential to allow centralized configuration of storage credentials for UI access for designated user groups 
* Add "All sources" view to UI Hyper-Dataset frame viewer
* Add task recent event log to UI task information 
* Add UI experiment scalar results table view
* Add show/hide specific frame annotations in UI Hyper-Dataset frame viewer
* Add UI edit of default Project default output destination
