    * Comparison animations overlapping other fields.
    * Cannot choose a metric after clearing it in experiment comparison parallel coordinates.
    * Adding a dimension without a value removes all lines in experiment comparison parallel coordinates.
* Fix experiment view issues:
    * Custom URL gets erased when clicking on any tab on experiment.
