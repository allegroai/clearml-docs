### Trains Server 0.14.2

**User survey**

* Add survey invitation popup.

**Bug fixes**

* Fix misaligned titles in experiment results, scalars, and plots (**RESULTS** tab, **SCALARS** and **PLOTS** sub-tabs).
* Fix parallel coordinate comparison in comparing experiments. Adding dimension with no values removes all lines.
* Fix resizing the experiments tables window. The preferences wheel jumped over the titles.
* Fix the browser zoom (**CTRL +**, **CTRL -**, and mouse wheel) in experiment **RESULTS** **>** **SCALARS** tab. It broke labels  ([GitHub Issue #127](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/127)).

### Trains Server 0.14.1

**Features and Bug Fixes**

* Support default **Trains Server** Kubernetes Helm ports in the **Trains Web-App (UI)**.
* Fix issue switching scalar plots between linear and logarithmic views ([GitHub Issue #75](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/75)).
* Do not reset view filtering when switching tabs in experiment view.

### Trains Server 0.14.0

**Features and Bug Fixes**

* Add debug image viewing for an unlimited number of iterations, filtering by metric, and comparing debug images for different iterations.
* Add debug image view zoom, fit to screen, resize, hover coordinates ([GitHub Issue #68](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/68)). 
* Add switching scalar plots between linear and logarithmic views  ([GitHub Issue #75](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/75)).
* Add scalar minimums and maximums to comparing experiments.
* Add opening HTML artifact files in the browser.
* Add Web-App notification for version updates.
* Add toggle button to switch between full screen and standard views in the **RESULTS** tab.
* Add a load more button to the global search results.
* Add automatic detection of debug video type from the file extension.
* Add `Task.get_parameters_as_dict` and `Task.set_parameters_as_dict`.
* Allow editing model description.
* Allow editing experiment uncommitted changes and installed packages separately.
* Allow deleting an input model from an experiment whose status is *Draft*.
* Fix dialog elements which are now accessible in non-100% screen scale. ([GitHub Issue #89](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/89)).
* Fix custom columns in the experiments table not properly loaded from browser store  ([GitHub Issue #106](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/106)).
* Fix issue with showing 2D graphs containing sub-plots ([trains #slack](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/106))
* Fix issues with vertical scrolling of experiment logs.
* Fix issue with image plots sometimes not visible in experiments comparison.
