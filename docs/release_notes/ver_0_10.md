## Version 0.10.5

### Trains

**Features and Bug Fixes**

* Add GPU monitoring support (add gpustat package to extras_require).
* Install with GPU monitoring support: 

        pip install trains[gpu]
        
* Move all cloud storage package requirements to extras_require. Install with specific cloud provider support:

    * Microsoft Azure support: 
    
            pip install trains[azure]
        
    * Google Storage support: 
    
            pip install trains[gs]
        
    * Amazon S3 support: 
    
            pip install trains[s3]
        
    * Combine Cloud support with GPU monitoring. For example, install S3 and GPU using the following command:
    
            pip install trains[s3,gpu]
    
* Improve stability with intermittent network connection.
* Support upgrading trains-server while running training jobs without losing log data.
