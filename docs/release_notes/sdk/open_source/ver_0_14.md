### Trains 0.14.3

**Features**
    
* Add the `Logger.report_histogram` method `mode` parameter.
 The values are `group` (the default), `stack`, and `relative`.
* Add [PEP610](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0610/) support for the new `pip` version 20.1 and newer Git reference 
  feature (see [pypa/pip#609](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/609)) ([GitHub Issue #62](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/62)).
* Improve support for PyTorch Ignite integration.
* Support `#` and `?` in uploaded image file names.

**Bug Fixes**

* Support `ArgumentParser.parse_arg` use before initializing a Task when `auto_connect_arg_parser=False`.
* Fix `upload_object_via_stream` in the Azure storage driver.
* Fix the `Task.get_tasks` method return type.


### Trains 0.14.2

**Features**
* Add media (audio) support for both `Logger` and TensorBoard binding using `Logger.report_media` ([GitHub Issue #120](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/120)).
* Add [autokeras example](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/blob/master/examples/frameworks/autokeras/autokeras_imdb_example.py) ([GitHub Issue #125](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/125)).
* Add caching of extracted zip artifacts.
* Add `Task.get_tasks` filtering support.
* Add `trains.storage.StorageManager`.
* Add nicer stdout log flush.
* Add text logging to TF V1 example.
* Improve SSL retries and error handling.
* Improve shutdown behavior in case of a user abort (Ctrl-C).
* Improve repository and module detection:
    * Improve resource monitor.
    * Report memory usage for process (and sub-processes).
    * Report GPU memory usage for process (and sub-processes).
    * Stability
* Improve Jupyter support:
    * Make sure `trains` is included in Jupyter requirements.
    * Ignore IPython directives in converted Python script (like `%` and `!` lines).
* Update PyTorch / TensorboardX examples.

**Bug Fixes**

* Fix renaming / deleting model file right after saving will break asynchronous upload ([GitHub Issue #123](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/123)).
* Fix shutdown behavior: 
    * Logger flush delay and termination.
    * Repository / package detection termination.
    * Threads termination.
* Fix text encoding `utf-8` and `pr_curve` broken in Tensorboard support.
* Fix single log request exceeds max packet size.
* Fix upload debug assets with series / title including `,` or `/` did not add iteration index to the filename.
* Fix `scikit-learn` module detection.
* Use UID in message if username cannot be retrieved.
* Fix cast in Tensorflow v2 example.


### Trains 0.14.1

**Features and Bug Fixes**

* Add OpenMPI / Slurm support, support `TRAINS_FORCE_MASTER_NODE` environment variable to allow forcefully specifying a node is master (not based on the MPI Rank).
* Add `Task.get_models` and `Task.models` for retrieving stored models for previously executed tasks
* Support multiple EventWriter in TensorFlow eager mode (TF 2.0+) ([GitHub Issue #26](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/26)).
* Support reusing models.
* Fix TensorFlow not a number (`NaN`) and infinity (`Inf`)
values support ([GitHub Issue #118](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/118)).
* Fix joblib binding.
* Fix metrics / files / models upload on shutdown.
* Fix support for Task init / close multiple times.
* Update `manual_reporting.py` example with `Logger.report_table` example.
* Deprecate `Task.set_model_config`, `Task.get_model_config_text`, and `Task.get_model_config_dict`.


### Trains 0.14.0

**Features and Bug Fixes**

* Add support for reporting tables (pandas.DataFrame, CSV files, URL to CSV file) using the `Logger.report_table` method.
* Add support for setting a Task's initial iteration to allow continuing previous runs using the `Task.set_initial_iteration` and `Task.get_initial_iteration` methods.
* Add multiprocess task support ([GitHub Issue #96](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/96)).
* Add `trains-init` support for config file override using the `TRAINS_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable or `--file` command line argument  ([GitHub Issue #105](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/105)).     
* Add initial slurm support.
* Allow disabling repository detection when calling `Task.init`.
* Add Jupyter Notebook server execution example.
* Update examples.
* Improve warning messages for storage errors and missing storage packages.
* Fix HTTP link quoting in stored links.
