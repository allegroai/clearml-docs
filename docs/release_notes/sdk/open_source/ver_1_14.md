* Fix setting `output_uri` when an AWS S3 config section with `secure=false` exists raises an error
* Fix `CacheManager` attempts to clear cache when file limit has not been reached resulting in slow unnecessary checks

### ClearML 1.14.3

**New Features and Bug Fixes**
* Add hash check for pickle files (resolves [CVE-2024-24590](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cpcw-9h9m-wqw9))
* Fix `clearml-task` relative paths calculation when `--cwd`, `--folder`, and `--script` are provided ([ClearML GitHub issue #1160](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/1160))
* Fix regression causing an error when `secure` is provided in AWS S3 bucket settings

### ClearML 1.14.2

**New Features and Improvements**
* Report upload/download with `tqdm` if installed
* Add support for a `PipelineController.version` property
* Add support for specifying an AWS profile when providing bucket storage credentials
* Add an `ignore_remote_overrides` argument to `Task.connect()` and `Task.connect_configuration()` allowing users to
  disable overriding values when running remotely
* Add support for setting a custom certificate path using the `CLEARML_API_HOST_VERIFY_CERT` environment variable 
  (instead of just allowing the user to disable verification)
* Add dataset reporting example ([ClearML GitHub PR #1180](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/pull/1180))

* Fix unsafe usage of `tempfile.mktemp`
* Fix potential path traversal on file download ([CVE-2024-24591](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m95h-p4gg-wfw3))
* Fix Python 3.12 support by not using `distutils`
* Fix `TaskScheduler` does not save local state before running remotely
* Fix pipeline should continue instead of aborting when `PipelineController.abort_on_failure` is set to `False` and a 
  step has been aborted
* Fix HPO crashes when its corresponding task is initialized with `continue_last_task=True`

### ClearML 1.14.1

**Bug Fix**
* Fix created pipelines do not appear in the UI pipelines section

### ClearML 1.14.0
**New Features and Improvements**
* Add support for decorated pipeline steps ([ClearML GitHub issue #1154](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/1154))
* Improve `torch.distributed` behavior and auto-detect Huggingface accelerate distributed execution
* Improve `jsonargparse` integration: `allow_config_file_override_from_ui` argument added for enabling/disabling 
overriding configuration file entries
* Add `raise_on_error` parameter to `Model.update_weights()` and `Model.update_weights_package()`
* Add HPO multi-objective optimization support by specifying multiple optimization objectives to the HyperParameterOptimizer class
* Improve pipelines from functions: libraries used by pipeline steps no longer have to be imported in the step itself 
and can be imported globally instead
* Support clearing repository details in `Task.set_repo()`
* Auto-detect `tensorflow-intel` as `tensorflow`
* Add support for auto-detecting `torch` and transformers `accelerate` distributed execution
* Add tabular data multi-stage pipeline process example

**Bug Fixes**
* Fix `langchain` integration ([ClearML GitHub issues #1124](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/1124) and [ClearML GitHub issue #1126](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/1126))
* Fix using `target_project` with `TaskScheduler.add_task()` corrupts project if used with pipelines ([ClearML GitHub issue #1137](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/1137))
* Fix `PipelineController.add_function_step()` fails when adding custom decorated step ([ClearML GitHub issue #1154](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/1154))
* Fix `jsonargparse` binding does not capture parameters before `Task.init()` is called ([ClearML GitHub issue #1164](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/1164))
* Fix invalid `jsonargparse` arguments should be deleted
* Fix handling of appended parameters to Hydra defaults list
* Fix `Task.set_repo()` and `Task.set_packages()` do not wait for automatic asynchronous repository detection
* Fix active GPU filtering in resource monitor to support GPU ID and not just GPU idx
* Fix misleading error raised when using the SDK with no configuration file or an invalid configuration file
* Fix process sometimes hangs issue by improving exit and exception handlers, unregistering signal handling in child 
processes except for the `BackgroundMonitor`
