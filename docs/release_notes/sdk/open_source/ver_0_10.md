* Removed apache-libcloud from requirements.
* `trains-init` now verifies credentials against the trains-server installation.


### Trains 0.10.6

**Features and Bug Fixes**

* Fix broken (v0.10.5) Keras Binding support.


### Trains 0.10.5

**Features and Bug Fixes**

* Add GPU monitoring support (add gpustat package to extras_require).
* Install with GPU monitoring support: 
  ```
  pip install trains[gpu]
  ```      
* Move all cloud storage package requirements to extras_require. Install with specific cloud provider support:

    * Microsoft Azure support: 
      ```
      pip install trains[azure]
      ```  
    * Google Storage support: 
      ```
      pip install trains[gs]
      ```  
    * Amazon S3 support: 
      ```
      pip install trains[s3]
      ```  
    * Combine Cloud support with GPU monitoring. For example, install S3 and GPU using the following command:
      ```
      pip install trains[s3,gpu]
      ```
* Improve stability with intermittent network connection.
* Support upgrading trains-server while running training jobs without losing log data.
