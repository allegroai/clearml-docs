### Trains 0.15.1

**Features**

* Add direct plotly figure reporting ([GitHub Issue #136](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/136)).
* Improve matplotlib integration ([GitHub Issue #140](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/140)).
* Add `Task.set_parent` ([GitHub Issue #144](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/144)).
* Add `Task.wait_for_status` ([GitHub Issue #145](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/145)).
* Enhance framework `save` / `load` binding callbacks ([pytorch/ignite Issue #1056](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/issues/1056)).
* Add `TrainsJob.is_failed`.
* Add APIClient support using `trains.backend_api.session.APIClient`.
* Add URL tracking when using `StorageManager.get_local_copy` (log remote URL instead of local file copy).
* Improve and expand examples.

**Bug Fixes**

* Fix `pytorch_tensorboard.py` example ([GitHub Issue #148](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/148)).
* Fix `ssh://user@domain@server.com/` in Git repository ([GitHub Issue #149](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/149)).
* Fix do not call `make_deterministic` on import.
* Fix initialization wizard (allow at most two verification retries, then print error) ([GitHub trains-agent Issue #16](https://github.com/allegroai/trains-agent/issues/16)).
* Fix Google CoLab code / package detection.
* Improve pytorch-ignite integration.
* Fix TensorFlow version 2 and later histogram binding.
* Fix `Logger.tensorboard_single_series_per_graph`.
* Fix anonymous named models.
* Fix incorrect entry point detection when called from Trains wrapper (e.g. `TrainsLogger` in PyTorch Ignite / Lightning).


### Trains 0.15.0

**Features**

* Add automation support including hyperparameter optimization (see example [here](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/blob/master/examples/optimization/hyper-parameter-optimization/hyper_parameter_optimizer.py))
* `Task.init` `auto_connect_arg_parser` argument can accept a dictionary disabling specific keys from the argparser (Trains Slack channel [thread](https://clearml.slack.com/archives/CTK20V944/p1589355878206700))
* Allow `worker_id` override using `TRAINS_WORKER_NAME` environment variable (Trains Slack channel [thread](https://clearml.slack.com/archives/CTK20V944/p1589920581251600?thread_ts=1589920220.250100&cid=CTK20V944))
* Support layout configuration for plotly objects using `extra_layout` argument in all `Logger` reporting methods  ([GitHub Issue #136](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/136)).
* Add `Task.execute_remotely` to allow cloning and enqueuing a locally executed task (or stopping and re-enqueuing a remotely executed task)  ([GitHub Issue #128](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/128)).
* Add Parquet framework and model type.
* Support recursive model folder packaging.
* Add `Task.get_reported_console_output` and `Task.get_reported_scalars` to allow retrieval of reported output and scalar metrics.
* Add `Task.add_requirements` to force requirement package into "installed packages."
* Improve task reuse responsiveness.
* Add `raise_on_error` (default False) argument to `Model.get_local_copy` and `Artifact.get_local_copy`  ([GitHub trains-agent Issue #17](https://github.com/allegroai/trains-agent/issues/17)).
* Support `Task.get_task` without project name (i.e. all projects)
* Support using the file calling `Task.init` as the task's script in case sys.argv doesn't point to a git repository
* Support detecting and remotely executing code running from a module (i.e. `-m module`)
* Add callback for framework `save` / `load` binding for better integration with pytorch / ignite ([GitHub pytorch/ignite Issue #1056](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/issues/1056))
* Support new task types provided in Trains Server v0.15.0
* Add automation and distributed examples
* Upgrade default pip version to `<20.2`

**Bug Fixes**

* Fix `exact_match_regex` in case of empty pattern  ([GitHub Issue #138](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/138)).
* Address deprecation warning and newer `attrs` versions in MetricsEventAdapter  ([GitHub Issue #134](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/134)).
* Fix issues with plotly support (Trains Slack channel [thread](https://clearml.slack.com/archives/CTK20V944/p1589871253243600) and [thread](https://clearml.slack.com/archives/CTK20V944/p1589279340195000)).
* Fix default argument behavior to match argparse behavior.
* Fix `OutputModel` with `task=None` should use current task, if exists.
* Fix `Task.get_task()` to raise proper error on incorrect `task_id`.
* Fix `Task.enqueue()` to use an exact queue name match.
* Fix `NaN`, `Inf` and `-Inf` values display in reported table (not supported by JSON).
* Limit max requirement size to 0.5 MB.
* Fix issues with repository analysis.
* Fix `StorageManager` so it should only try to extract .zip files, `Model` should not auto extract package  ([GitHub trains-agent Issue #17](https://github.com/allegroai/trains-agent/issues/17)).
