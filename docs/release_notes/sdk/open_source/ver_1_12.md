### ClearML 1.12.2

**New Features and Improvements**
* Add `always_create_from_code` argument to `PipelineController` (default `True`) to allow remote execution to create 
the Pipeline DAG at runtime (as opposed to adhering to the existing structure stored on the task when running locally)

**Bug Fixes**
* Fix using `OutputModel` reporting and other methods fail if `OutputModel.update_weights()` is not called before that ([ClearML GitHub issue #1078](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/1078))
* Fix hash for Pandas objects artifacts
* Fix Hydra/OmegaConf `--overrides` support
* Fix Pipeline metrics not forwarded to pipeline controller at the end of a pipeline step

### ClearML 1.12.1

**New Features and Improvements**
* Raise error if dataset name is empty ([ClearML GitHub PR #1083](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/pull/1083))
* Add support for `spawn` start method for Python `multiprocess`. This should help circumvent issues like [this](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84559).

**Bug Fix**
* Fix S3 uploads fail with `LazyEvalWrapper` type error ([ClearML GitHub issue #1081](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/1081))
