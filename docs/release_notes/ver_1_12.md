### ClearML SDK 1.12.2

**New Features and Improvements**
* Add `always_create_from_code` argument to `PipelineController` (default `True`) to allow remote execution to create 
the Pipeline DAG at runtime (as opposed to adhering to the existing structure stored on the task when running locally)

**Bug Fixes**
* Fix using `OutputModel` reporting and other methods fail if `OutputModel.update_weights()` is not called before that ([ClearML GitHub issue #1078](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/1078))

**New Features and Improvements**
* Raise error if dataset name is empty ([ClearML GitHub PR #1083](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/pull/1083))
* Add support for `spawn` start method for Python `multiprocess`. This should help circumvent issues like [this](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84559).
