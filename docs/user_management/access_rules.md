title: Access Rules
---

:::important Enterprise Feature
Access Rules are available under the ClearML Enterprise plan.
:::

Workspace administrators can use Access Rules to specify which users, service accounts and/or [user groups](user_groups.md) 
have access to various workspace resources: projects, tasks, models, dataviews, hyper-datasets and queues. Admins can 
specify **Read Only** or **Read & Modify** access to resources. 

Through access rules, administrators can enforce and maintain workspace information security.

For more information see [Access Rules](../webapp/settings/webapp_settings_access_rules.md).
