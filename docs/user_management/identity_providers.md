:::important Enterprise Feature
This feature is available under the ClearML Enterprise plan.
:::

Administrators can seamlessly connect ClearML with their identity service providers to easily implement single sign-on 
(SSO). On top of authenticating users, this also allows ClearML to retrieve user information and more. Once an identity 
provider connection is configured and enabled, the option appears in your server login page.

ClearML supports standard protocols such as OIDC and SAML, and popular providers, including Auth0, Google, Okta, and more.
