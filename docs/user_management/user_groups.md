title: User Groups
---

:::important Enterprise Feature
User Groups are available under the ClearML Enterprise plan.
:::

Administrators can define user groups, which can be used for access privilege management. User groups facilitate easy 
configuration and access control administration by allowing administrators to assign administrator vaults and access 
rules at the group level rather than for each user and/or [service account](../webapp/settings/webapp_settings_users.md#service-accounts) 
individually. Administrators have the flexibility to create user groups, and add or remove members as needed.

For more information see [User Groups](../webapp/settings/webapp_settings_users.md#user-groups).
