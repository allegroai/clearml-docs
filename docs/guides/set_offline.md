title: Storing Task Data Offline
---

If your computer is offline, or you do not want a Task's data and logs stored in the ClearML Server, use
the **Offline Mode** option. In this mode, all the data and logs that the Task captures from the code are stored in a 
local folder, which can be later uploaded to the [ClearML Server](../deploying_clearml/clearml_server.md).

## Setting Task to Offline Mode

Before initializing a Task, use the [Task.set_offline](../references/sdk/task.md#taskset_offline) class method and set the 
`offline_mode` argument to `True`.

```python
from clearml import Task
# Use the set_offline class method before initializing a Task
Task.set_offline(offline_mode=True)
# Initialize a Task 
task = Task.init(project_name="examples", task_name="my_task")

# Rest of code is executed. All data is logged locally and not onto the server
```

The method returns the Task ID and a path to the session folder:

```console
ClearML Task: created new task id=offline-372657bb04444c25a31bc6af86552cc9
...
...
ClearML Task: Offline session stored in /home/user/.clearml/cache/offline/b786845decb14eecadf2be24affc7418.zip
```

All the information captured by the Task is saved locally. Once the task script finishes execution, it's zipped. The 
session's zip folder's location is `~/.clearml/cache/offline/<task_id>.zip`.

## Uploading Session Data

Upload the session's execution data that the Task captured offline to the ClearML Server using one of the following:


* `clearml-task` CLI
    
  ```bash
  clearml-task --import-offline-session "/home/user/.clearml/cache/offline/b786845decb14eecadf2be24affc7418.zip"
  ```

  Pass the path to the zip folder containing the session with the `--import-offline-session` parameter.
  
* [Task.import_offline_session](../references/sdk/task.md#taskimport_offline_session) method. 

  ```python
  from clearml import Task

  Task.import_offline_session(
      session_folder_zip="/home/user/.clearml/cache/offline/b786845decb14eecadf2be24affc7418.zip"
  )
  ```

  In the `session_folder_zip` argument, insert the path to the zip folder containing the session.


Both options will upload the Task's full execution details and outputs and return a link to the Task's results page on 
the ClearML Server:

```console
ClearML: Importing offline session from /home/user/.clearml/cache/offline/b786845decb14eecadf2be24affc7418.zip
ClearML results page: https://app.clear.ml/projects/4043a1657f374e9298649c6ba72ad233/experiments/bb8b0f6fa0f94536a0d27fb55f02d3a5/output/log
```

The session details can be viewed in the ClearML WebApp, in the "my_task" experiment of the "examples" 
project, as specified when initializing the Task.
