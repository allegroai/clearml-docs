title: Multiple Tasks in Single Process
---

The [multiple_tasks_single_process](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/blob/master/examples/advanced/multiple_tasks_single_process.py)
script demonstrates the capability to log a single script in multiple ClearML tasks.  

In order to log a script in multiple tasks, each task needs to be initialized using the [`Task.init`](../../references/sdk/task.md#taskinit) 
method with the `task_name` and `project_name` parameters input. Before initializing an additional task in the same script, the 
previous task must be manually shut down with the [`close`](../../references/sdk/task.md#close) method. 

When the script is executed, it should return something like this:

```text

Notice that three separate tasks with distinct IDs are created, and a link is provided to view the results of each one.
