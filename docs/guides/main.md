To help learn and use ClearML, we provide example scripts that demonstrate how to use ClearML's various features. 

Examples scripts are in the [examples](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/tree/master/examples) folder of the GitHub `clearml` 
repository. They are also pre-loaded in the **ClearML Server**:

Each examples folder in the GitHub ``clearml`` repository contains a ``requirements.txt`` file for example scripts in that folder.
