title: Tuning Experiments
---

In this tutorial, learn how to tune an experiment. The experiment that will be tuned is created by the [pytorch_mnist.py](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/blob/master/examples/frameworks/pytorch/pytorch_mnist.py) 
example script. 

## Prerequisites

* Clone the [clearml](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml) repository.
* Install the [requirements](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/blob/master/examples/frameworks/tensorflow/requirements.txt) 
  for the TensorFlow examples.
* Have **ClearML Agent** [installed and configured](../../clearml_agent.md#installation).

## Step 1: Run the Experiment

In the `examples/frameworks/pytorch` directory, run the experiment script:

    python pytorch_mnist.py

## Step 2: Clone the Experiment

Clone the experiment to create an editable copy for tuning.

1. In the **ClearML Web-App (UI)**, on the Projects page, click the `examples` project card.

1. In the experiments table, right-click the experiment `pytorch mnist train`.

1. In the context menu, click **Clone** **>** **CLONE**. The newly cloned experiment appears and its info panel slides open.

## Step 3: Tune the Cloned Experiment

To demonstrate tuning, change two hyperparameter values.

1. In the info panel, **CONFIGURATION** **>** **HYPERPARAMETERS** **>** **Args** **>** Hover and click **EDIT**.

1. Change the value of `batch_size` from `64` to `32`.

1. Change the value of `lr` from `0.01` to `0.025`.

1. Click **SAVE**.

## Step 4: Run a Worker Daemon Listening to a Queue

To execute the cloned experiment, use a worker that can run a worker daemon listening to a queue.

:::note
For more information about workers, worker daemons, and queues, see [Agents and queues](../../fundamentals/agents_and_queues.md).
:::

Run the worker daemon on the local development machine.
1. Open a terminal session.
1. Run the following `clearml-agent` command which runs a worker daemon listening to the `default` queue:

        clearml-agent daemon --queue default
    
    The response to this command is information about the configuration, the worker, and the queue. For example:

        Current configuration (clearml_agent v0.16.0, location: /home/<username>/clearml.conf):
        ----------------------
        agent.worker_id =
        agent.worker_name = LAPTOP-PPTKKPGK
        agent.python_binary =
        agent.package_manager.type = pip
        .
        .
        .
        sdk.development.worker.report_period_sec = 2
        sdk.development.worker.ping_period_sec = 30
        sdk.development.worker.log_stdout = true
        
        Worker "LAPTOP-PPTKKPGK:0" - Listening to queues:
        + ---------------------------------+---------+-------+
        | id                               | name    | tags  |
        + ---------------------------------+---------+-------+
        | 2a03daf5ff9a4255b9915fbd5306f924 | default |       |
        + ---------------------------------+---------+-------+
        
        Running CLEARML-AGENT daemon in background mode, writing stdout/stderr to /home/<username>/.clearml_agent_daemon_outym6lqxrz.txt

## Step 5: Enqueue the Tuned Experiment

Enqueue the tuned experiment.

1. In the **ClearML Web-App (UI)**, experiments table, right-click the experiment `Clone Of pytorch mnist train`.

1. In the context menu, click **Enqueue**.

1. Select **Default** queue. 
   
1. Click **ENQUEUE**. The experiment's status becomes Pending. When the worker fetches the experiment from the queue, 
   the status becomes Running. The progress of the experiment can be viewed in the info panel. When the status becomes 
   Completed, continue to the next step.

## Step 6: Compare the Experiments

To compare the original and tuned experiments:
1. In the **ClearML Web-App (UI)**, on the Projects page, click the `examples` project.
1. In the experiments table, select the checkboxes for the two experiments: `pytorch mnist train` and `Clone Of pytorch mnist train`.
1. On the menu bar at the bottom of the experiments table, click **COMPARE**. The experiment comparison window appears. 
   All differences appear with a different background color to highlight them.

    The experiment comparison window is organized in the following tabs:
    * **DETAILS** - The **ARTIFACTS** section, including input and output models with their network designs, and other artifacts;
        the **EXECUTION** section execution, including source code control, installed Python packages and versions, 
      uncommitted changes, and the Docker image name which, in this case, is empty.
    * **HYPERPARAMETERS** - The hyperparameters and their values.
    * **SCALARS** - Scalar metrics with the option to view them as charts or values.
    * **PLOTS** - Plots of any data with the option to view them as charts or values.
    * **DEBUG SAMPLES** - Media including images, audio, and video uploaded by your experiment shown as thumbnails.
1. Examine the differences.
    1. Compare the hyperparameters. In the **HYPERPARAMETERS** tab, expand **ARGS**. The hyperparameters `batch_size` 
       and `lr` are shown with a different background color. The values are different.
    1. Compare the metrics. In the **SCALARS** tab, to the right of **Add Experiment**, select the plot or value comparison:
        * **Graph** - The scalar metrics plots show `pytorch mnist train` and `Clone of pytorch mnist train`.
        * **Last Values** - Expand a metric and variant.
