## General Information

**How do I know a new version came out? <a className="tr_top_negative" id="new-version-auto-update"></a>**

Starting with ClearML v0.9.3, ClearML issues a new version release notification, which appears in the log and is 
output to the console, when a Python experiment script is run.

For example, when a new ClearML Python Package version is available, the notification is:

    CLEARML new package available: UPGRADE to vX.Y.Z is recommended!

When a new ClearML Server version is available, the notification is:

    CLEARML-SERVER new version available: upgrade to vX.Y is recommended!


<br/>

**How do I find out ClearML version information?** <a id="versions"></a>

ClearML server version information is available in the ClearML webapp Settings page. On the bottom right of the page, 
it says **Version**, followed by three numbers: the web application version, the API server version, and the API version.

![Server version information](img/faq_server_versions.png)

ClearML python package information can be obtained by using `pip freeze`.

For example: 

```
pip freeze|grep clearml
```

should return something like this:

```console
clearml==1.0.3rc1
clearml-agent==1.0.0
clearml-session==0.3.2
```


## Models

**How can I sort models by a certain metric?** <a id="custom-columns"></a>

ClearML associates models with the experiments that created them. To sort experiments by a metric, in the ClearML Web UI, 
add a [custom column](webapp/webapp_exp_table.md#customizing-the-experiments-table) in the experiments table and sort by 
that metric column. 

<br/> 

**Can I store more information on the models?** <a id="store-more-model-info"></a>

Yes! For example, you can use the [Task.set_model_label_enumeration](references/sdk/task.md#set_model_label_enumeration) 
method to store label enumeration:

```python
Task.current_task().set_model_label_enumeration( {"label": int(0), } )
```
    

For more information about `Task` class methods, see the [Task Class](fundamentals/task.md) reference page.

<br/>

**Can I store the model configuration file as well?**  <a id="store-model-configuration"></a>

Yes! Use the [Task.set_model_config](references/sdk/task.md#set_model_config) 
method:

```python
Task.current_task().set_model_config("a very long text with the configuration file's content")
```
 
<br/>

**I am training multiple models at the same time, but I only see one of them. What happened?** <a id="only-last-model-appears"></a>

Currently, in the experiment info panel, ClearML shows only the last associated model. In the ClearML Web UI, 
on the Projects page, the MODELS tab shows all models.

This will be improved in a future version.

<br/>

**Can I log input and output models manually?** <a id="manually-log-models"></a>

Yes! Use the [InputModel.import_model](references/sdk/model_inputmodel.md#inputmodelimport_model) 
and [Task.connect](references/sdk/task.md#connect) methods to manually connect an input model. Use the 
[OutputModel.update_weights](references/sdk/model_outputmodel.md#update_weights) 
method to manually connect a model weights file.

```python
input_model = InputModel.import_model(link_to_initial_model_file)
Task.current_task().connect(input_model)

OutputModel(Task.current_task()).update_weights(link_to_new_model_file_here)
```

For more information about models, see [InputModel](references/sdk/model_inputmodel.md) 
and [OutputModel](references/sdk/model_outputmodel.md) classes.

<br/>

**Models are not accessible the UI after I migrated ClearML Server to a new domain. How do I fix this?** <a id="migrate_server_models"></a>

This can happen if your models were uploaded to the ClearML files server, since the value registered was their full URL 
at the time of registration (e.g. `https://files.<OLD_DOMAIN>/path/to/model`).

To fix this, the registered URL of each model needs to be replaced with its current URL.

To replace the URL of each model, execute the following commands:

1. Open bash in the mongo DB docker container: 

    ```bash 
    sudo docker exec -it clearml-mongo /bin/bash
    ```

1. Create the following script inside the Docker shell:  
   as well as the URL protocol if you aren't using `s3`. 
    ```bash
    cat <<EOT >> script.js
    db.model.find({uri:{$regex:/^s3/}}).forEach(function(e,i) {
    e.uri = e.uri.replace("s3://<old-bucket-name>/","s3://<new-bucket-name>/");
    db.model.save(e);});
    EOT 
    ```
    Make sure to replace `<old-bucket-name>` and `<new-bucket-name>`.
1. Run the script against the backend DB:

   ```bash
   mongo backend script.js
   ```
<br/>

**Models are not accessible from the UI after I moved them (different bucket / server). How do I fix this?** <a id="relocate_models"></a>

This can happen if your models were uploaded to the ClearML files server, since the value registered was their full URL 
at the time of registration (e.g. `https://files.<OLD_DOMAIN>/path/to/model`).

To fix this, the registered URL of each model needs to be replaced with its current URL:

1. Open bash in the mongo DB Docker container: 

   ```bash
   sudo docker exec -it clearml-mongo /bin/bash
   ```

1. Create the following script inside the Docker shell.  
    ```bash
    cat <<EOT >> script.js
    db.model.find({uri:{$regex:/^s3/}}).forEach(function(e,i) {
    e.uri = e.uri.replace("s3://<old-bucket-name>/","s3://<new-bucket-name>/");
    db.model.save(e);});
    EOT 
    ```
   Make sure to replace `<old-bucket-name>` and `<new-bucket-name>`, as well as the URL protocol prefixes if you aren't using S3.
1. Run the script against the backend DB:

    ```bash
    mongo backend script.js
    ```

## Experiments

**I noticed I keep getting the message "warning: uncommitted code". What does it mean?** <a id="uncommitted-code-warning"></a>

This message is only a warning. ClearML not only detects your current repository and git commit, but also warns you 
if you are using uncommitted code. ClearML does this because uncommitted code means this experiment will be difficult 
to reproduce. You can see uncommitted changes in the ClearML Web UI, in the EXECUTION tab of the experiment info panel.

**I do not use argparse for hyperparameters. Do you have a solution?** <a id="dont-want-argparser"></a>

Yes! ClearML supports connecting hyperparameter dictionaries to experiments, using the [Task.connect](references/sdk/task.md#connect) method.

For example, to log the hyperparameters `learning_rate`, `batch_size`, `display_step`,
`model_path`, `n_hidden_1`, and `n_hidden_2`:

```python
# Create a dictionary of parameters
parameters_dict = { 'learning_rate': 0.001, 'batch_size': 100, 'display_step': 1, 
                    'model_path': "/tmp/model.ckpt", 'n_hidden_1': 256, 'n_hidden_2': 256 }
        
# Connect the dictionary to your CLEARML Task
parameters_dict = Task.current_task().connect(parameters_dict)
```
    

<br/>

**I noticed that all of my experiments appear as "Training" Are there other options?** <a id="other-experiment-types"></a>

Yes! When creating experiments and calling [Task.init](references/sdk/task.md#taskinit), 
you can provide an experiment type. ClearML supports [multiple experiment types](fundamentals/task.md#task-types). For example:

```python
task = Task.init(project_name, task_name, Task.TaskTypes.testing)
```
    

<br/>

**Sometimes I see experiments as running when in fact they are not. What's going on?** <a id="experiment-running-but-stopped"></a>

ClearML monitors your Python process. When the process exits properly, ClearML closes the experiment. When the process crashes and terminates abnormally, it sometimes misses the stop signal. In this case, you can safely right click the experiment in the Web-App and abort it.

<br/>

**My code throws an exception, but my experiment status is not "Failed". What happened?** <a id="exception-not-failed"></a>

This issue was resolved in Trains v0.9.2. Upgrade to ClearML by executing the following command:

    pip install -U clearml

<a id="ssl-connection-error"></a>

<br/>

**When I run my experiment, I get an SSL Connection error CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED. Do you have a solution?**

Your firewall may be preventing the connection. Try one of the following solutions:

* Direct python "requests" to use the enterprise certificate file by setting the OS environment variables CURL_CA_BUNDLE or REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE. For a detailed discussion of this topic, see [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48391750/disable-python-requests-ssl-validation-for-an-imported-module](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48391750/disable-python-requests-ssl-validation-for-an-imported-module).
* Disable certificate verification   
  
  :::warning
  For security reasons, it is not recommended to disable certificate verification
  :::
    1. Upgrade ClearML to the current version:
        
            pip install -U clearml
        
    1. Create a new `clearml.conf` configuration file (see a [sample configuration file](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/blob/master/docs/clearml.conf)), containing:
        
            api { verify_certificate = False }
        
    1. Copy the new `clearml.conf` file to:
         * Linux - `~/clearml.conf`
         * Mac - `$HOME/clearml.conf`
         * Windows - `\User\<username>\clearml.conf``~/clearml.conf` 
   
<a id="modify_exp_names"></a>

<br/>

**How do I modify experiment names once they have been created?**

An experiment's name is a user-controlled property, which can be accessed via the `Task.name` variable. This allows you to use meaningful naming schemes for easily filtering and comparing of experiments.

For example, to distinguish between different experiments, you can append the task ID to the task name:
```python
task = Task.init('examples', 'train')
task.name += ' {}'.format(task.id)
```

Or, append the Task ID post-execution:
```python
tasks = Task.get_tasks(project_name='examples', task_name='train')
for t in tasks:
    t.name += ' {}'.format(task.id)
```

Another example is to append a specific hyperparameter and its value to each task's name:
```python
tasks = Task.get_tasks(project_name='examples', task_name='my_automl_experiment')
for t in tasks:
    params = t.get_parameters()
    if 'my_secret_parameter' in params:
        t.name += ' my_secret_parameter={}'.format(params['my_secret_parameter'])
```
Use this experiment naming when creating automation pipelines with a naming convention.

<a id="typing"></a>

<br/>

**Using Conda and the "typing" package, I get the error "AttributeError: type object 'Callable' has no attribute '_abc_registry'". How do I fix this?**

Conda and the [typing](https://pypi.org/project/typing/) package may have some compatibility issues. 

However, [since Python 3.5](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/typing.html), the `typing` package is part of the standard library. 

To resolve the error, uninstall `typing` and rerun you script. If this does not fix the issue, create a [new ClearML issue](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues/new), including the full error, and your environment details.  

<a id="delete_exp"></a>

<br/>

**My ClearML Server disk space usage is too high. What can I do about this?**

We designed the ClearML open source suite, including ClearML Server, to ensure experiment traceability. For this reason, the ClearML Web UI does not include a feature to delete experiments. The ClearML Web UI does allow you to archive experiments so that they appear only in the Archive area.
 
In rare instances, however, such as high disk usage for a privately-hosted ClearML Server because Elasticsearch is indexing unwanted experiments, you may choose to delete an experiment.

You can use the `APIClient` provided by ClearML Agent and
`client.tasks.delete()` to delete an experiment. 

:::warning
You cannot undo the deletion of an experiment.
:::

For example, the following script deletes an experiment whose Task ID is `123456789`.
```python
from clearml_agent import APIClient
    
client = APIClient()
client.tasks.delete(task='123456789')
```

<a id="random_see"></a>

<br/>

**Can I change the random seed my experiment uses?**

Yes! By default, ClearML initializes Tasks with a default seed. You change that seed by calling the [make_deterministic](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/blob/2f5b519cd8c4df9d3db397604f5b8097c23ccc40/trains/utilities/seed.py) method.

<a id="access_files"></a>

<br/>

**In the Web UI, I can't access files that my experiment stored. Why not?**

ClearML stores file locations. The machine running your browser must have access to the location where the machine 
that ran the Task stored the file. This applies to debug samples and artifacts. If, for example, the machine running the browser does not have access, you may see "Unable to load image", instead of the image.

<a id="resource_monitoring"></a>

<br/>

**I get the message "CLEARML Monitor: Could not detect iteration reporting, falling back to iterations as seconds-from-start". What does it mean?**

If metric reporting begins within the first three minutes, ClearML reports resource monitoring by iteration. Otherwise, 
it reports resource monitoring by seconds from start, and logs a message:
```      
CLEARML Monitor: Could not detect iteration reporting, falling back to iterations as seconds-from-start. 
```
However, if metric reporting begins after three minutes and anytime up to thirty minutes, resource monitoring reverts to 
by iteration, and ClearML logs a message 
```
CLEARML Monitor: Reporting detected, reverting back to iteration based reporting. 
```
After thirty minutes, it remains unchanged.

<br/>

**Can I control what ClearML automatically logs?** <a id="controlling_logging"></a>

Yes! ClearML allows you to control automatic logging for `stdout`, `stderr`, and frameworks when initializing a Task
by calling the [`Task.init`](references/sdk/task.md#taskinit) method. 

To control a Task's framework logging, use the `auto_connect_frameworks` parameter. Turn off all automatic logging by setting the 
parameter to `False`. For finer grained control of logged frameworks, input a dictionary, with framework-boolean pairs. 

For example: 
```python
auto_connect_frameworks={
    'matplotlib': True, 'tensorflow': False, 'tensorboard': False, 'pytorch': True,
    'xgboost': False, 'scikit': True, 'fastai': True, 'lightgbm': False,
    'hydra': True, 'detect_repository': True, 'tfdefines': True, 'joblib': True,
    'megengine': True, 'jsonargparse': True, 'catboost': True
}
```

To control the `stdout`, `stderr`, and standard logging, use the `auto_connect_streams` parameter. 
To disable logging all three, set the parameter to `False`. For finer grained control, input a dictionary, where the keys are `stout`, `stderr`, 
and `logging`, and the values are booleans. For example: 

```python
auto_connect_streams={'stdout': True, 'stderr': True, 'logging': False}
```

See [`Task.init`](references/sdk/task.md#taskinit).

<br/>


**Can I run ClearML Task while working offline?** <a id="offline_mode"></a>

Yes! You can use ClearML's Offline Mode, in which all the data and logs that a task captures from the code are stored in a 
local folder. 

Before initializing a task, use the [Task.set_offline](references/sdk/task.md#taskset_offline) 
class method and set the `offline_mode` argument to `True`. When executed, this returns the Task ID and a path to the 
session folder. In order to upload to the ClearML Server the execution data that the Task captured offline, do one of the
following:
* Use the `import-offline-session <session_path>` option of the [clearml-task](apps/clearml_task.md) CLI
* Use the [Task.import_offline_session](references/sdk/task.md#taskimport_offline_session) method. 
  
See [Storing Task Data Offline](guides/set_offline.md).



## Graphs and Logs

**The first log lines are missing from the experiment console tab. Where did they go?** <a id="first-log-lines-missing"></a>

Due to speed/optimization issues, the console displays only the last several hundred log lines.

You can always download the full log as a file using the ClearML Web UI. In the ClearML Web UI > experiment 
info panel > CONSOLE tab, use the *Download full log* feature.

<br/>

**Can I create a graph comparing hyperparameters vs. model accuracy?** <a id="compare-graph-parameters"></a>

Yes! You can manually create a plot with a single point X-axis for the hyperparameter value, and Y-axis for the accuracy. 
For example:

```python
number_layers = 10
accuracy = 0.95
Task.current_task().get_logger().report_scatter2d(
    "performance", 
    "accuracy", 
    iteration=0, 
    mode='markers', 
    scatter=[(number_layers, accuracy)]
)
```

Assuming the hyperparameter is `number_layers` with current value `10`, and the `accuracy` for the trained model is `0.95`. Then, the experiment comparison graph shows:

![image](img/clearml_faq_screenshots/compare_plots.png)

Another option is a histogram chart:

```python
number_layers = 10
accuracy = 0.95
Task.current_task().get_logger().report_vector(
    "performance", 
    "accuracy", 
    iteration=0, 
    labels=['accuracy'],
    values=[accuracy], 
    xlabels=['number_layers %d' % number_layers]
)

```

![image](img/clearml_faq_screenshots/compare_plots_hist.png)

<br/>

**I want to add more graphs, not just with TensorBoard. Is this supported?** <a id="more-graph-types"></a>

Yes! The [Logger](fundamentals/logger.md) module includes methods for explicit reporting. For examples of explicit reporting, see the [Explicit Reporting](guides/reporting/explicit_reporting.md) 
tutorial, which includes a list of methods for explicit reporting.

<br/>

**How can I report more than one scatter 2D series on the same plot?**  <a id="multiple-scatter2D"></a>

The [`Logger.report_scatter2d()`](references/sdk/logger.md#report_scatter2dtitle-series-scatter-iteration-xaxisnone-yaxisnone-labelsnone-modelines-commentnone-extra_layoutnone) 
method reports all series with the same `title` and `iteration` parameter values on the same plot.

For example, the following two scatter2D series are reported on the same plot, because both have a `title` of `example_scatter` and an `iteration` of `1`:

```python
scatter2d_1 = np.hstack((np.atleast_2d(np.arange(0, 10)).T, np.random.randint(10, size=(10, 1))))
logger.report_scatter2d(
    "example_scatter",
    "series_1", 
    iteration=1, 
    scatter=scatter2d_1,
    xaxis="title x", 
    yaxis="title y"
)
    
scatter2d_2 = np.hstack((np.atleast_2d(np.arange(0, 10)).T, np.random.randint(10, size=(10, 1))))
logger.report_scatter2d(
    "example_scatter", 
    "series_2", 
    iteration=1, 
    scatter=scatter2d_2,
    xaxis="title x", 
    yaxis="title y"
)

```

## GIT and Storage

**Is there something ClearML can do about uncommitted code running?**  <a id="help-uncommitted-code"></a>

Yes! ClearML stores the git diff as part of the experiment's information. You can view the git diff in the ClearML Web UI, 
experiment info panel > EXECUTION tab.

<br/>

**I read there is a feature for centralized model storage. How do I use it?** <a id="centralized-model-storage"></a>

When calling [Task.init](references/sdk/task.md#taskinit), 
providing the `output_uri` parameter allows you to specify the location in which model checkpoints (snapshots) will be stored.

For example, to store model checkpoints (snapshots) in `/mnt/shared/folder`:

```python
task = Task.init(project_name, task_name, output_uri="/mnt/shared/folder")
```

ClearML will copy all stored snapshots into a subfolder under `/mnt/shared/folder`. The subfolder's name will contain 
the experiment's ID. If the experiment's ID is `6ea4f0b56d994320a713aeaf13a86d9d`, the following folder will be used:
```
/mnt/shared/folder/task.6ea4f0b56d994320a713aeaf13a86d9d/models/
```

ClearML supports other storage types for `output_uri`, including:
```python
# AWS S3 bucket
task = Task.init(project_name, task_name, output_uri="s3://bucket-name/folder")

# Google Cloud Storage bucket
task = Task.init(project_name, task_name, output_uri="gs://bucket-name/folder")
```

To use Cloud storage with ClearML, configure the storage credentials in your `~/clearml.conf`. For detailed information, 
see [ClearML Configuration Reference](configs/clearml_conf.md).

<a id="pycharm-remote-debug-detect-git"></a>

<br/>

**When using PyCharm to remotely debug a machine, the Git repo is not detected. Do you have a solution?**

Yes! ClearML provides a PyCharm plugin that allows a remote debugger to grab your local 
repository / commit ID. For detailed information about using the plugin, see the [ClearML PyCharm Plugin](guides/ide/integration_pycharm.md).

<br/>

**Debug images and/or artifacts are not loading in the UI after I migrated ClearML Server to a new domain. How do I fix this?**  <a id="migrate_server_debug"></a>  

This can happen if your debug images and / or artifacts were uploaded to the ClearML file server, since the value
registered was their full URL at the time of registration (e.g. `https://files.<OLD_DOMAIN>/path/to/artifact`).

To fix this, the registered URL of each debug image and / or artifact needs to be replaced with its current URL.

* For **debug images**, use the following command. Make sure to insert the old domain and the new domain that will replace it
    ```bash
    curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --request POST \
    --data '{
        "script": {
            "source": "ctx._source.url = ctx._source.url.replace('https://files.<OLD_DOMAIN>', 'https://files.<NEW_DOMAIN>')",
            "lang": "painless"
        },
        "query": {
            "match_all": {}
        }
    }' \
    ```

* For **artifacts**, you can do the following: 

    1. Open bash in the mongo DB docker container:

    ```bash 
    sudo docker exec -it clearml-mongo /bin/bash
    ```

    1. Inside the docker shell, create the following script. Make sure to replace `<old-bucket-name>` and `<new-bucket-name>`, 
   as well as the URL protocol prefixes if you aren't using `s3`. 
   
    ```bash
    cat <<EOT >> script.js
    db.model.find({uri:{$regex:/^s3/}}).forEach(function(e,i) {
    e.uri = e.uri.replace("s3://<old-bucket-name>/","s3://<new-bucket-name>/");
    db.model.save(e);});
    EOT 
    ```

    1. Run the script against the backend DB:

    ```bash
    mongo backend script.js
    ```
   

## Jupyter

**I am using Jupyter Notebook. Is this supported?** <a id="jupyter-notebook"></a>

Yes! You can run ClearML in Jupyter Notebooks using either of the following:

* Option 1: Install ClearML on your Jupyter Notebook host machine
* Option 2: Install ClearML in your Jupyter Notebook and connect using ClearML credentials

**Option 1: Install ClearML on your Jupyter host machine**

1. Connect to your Jupyter host machine.
1. Install the ClearML Python Package.

        pip install clearml

1. Run the ClearML initialize wizard.

        clearml-init
    
1. In your Jupyter Notebook, you can now use ClearML.
        
**Option 2: Install ClearML in your Jupyter Notebook**

1. In the ClearML Web UI > **Settings > Workspace** page, create credentials and copy your access key and secret key. These are required in the Step 3.

1. Install the ClearML Python Package.

        pip install clearml

1. Use the [Task.set_credentials](references/sdk/task.md#taskset_credentials) 
   method to specify the host, port, access key and secret key (see step 1).
   ```python
   # Set your credentials using the clearml apiserver URI and port, access_key, and secret_key.
   Task.set_credentials(host='http://localhost:8008',key='<access_key>', secret='<secret_key>')
   ```
   
   :::note 
   `host` is the API server (default port `8008`), not the web server (default port `8080`).
   :::
   
1. You can now use ClearML.
   ```python
   # create a task and start training
   task = Task.init('juptyer project', 'my notebook')
   ```
        

<a id="commit-git-in-jupyter"></a>

<br/>

## Remote Debugging (ClearML PyCharm Plugin)

**I am using your ClearML PyCharm Plugin for remote debugging. I get the message "clearml.Task - INFO - Repository and 
package analysis timed out (10.0 sec), giving up". What should I do?**<a id="package_thread"></a>

ClearML uses a background thread to analyze the script. This includes package requirements. At the end of the execution
of the script, if the background thread is still running, ClearML allows the thread another 10 seconds to complete. 
If the thread does not complete, it times out.

This can occur for scripts that do not import any packages, for example short test scripts.

To fix this issue, you could import the `time` package and add a `time.sleep(20)` statement to the end of your script.

## scikit-learn

**Can I use ClearML with scikit-learn?** <a id="use-scikit-learn"></a>

Yes! `scikit-learn` is supported. Everything you do is logged. ClearML automatically logs models which are stored using `joblib`. 
See the scikit-learn examples with [Matplotlib](guides/frameworks/scikit-learn/sklearn_matplotlib_example.md) and [Joblib](guides/frameworks/scikit-learn/sklearn_joblib_example.md).

## ClearML Configuration

**How do I explicitly specify the ClearML configuration file to be used?** <a id="change-config-path"></a>

To override the default configuration file location, set the `CLEARML_CONFIG_FILE` OS environment variable.

For example:

    export CLEARML_CONFIG_FILE="/home/user/myclearml.conf"

<br/>

**How can I override ClearML credentials from the OS environment?** <a id="credentials-os-env"></a>

To override your configuration file / defaults, set the following OS environment variables:

    export CLEARML_API_ACCESS_KEY="key_here"
    export CLEARML_API_SECRET_KEY="secret_here"
    export CLEARML_API_HOST="http://localhost:8008"

<br/>

**How can I track OS environment variables with experiments?**  <a id="track-env-vars"></a>

Set the OS environment variable `CLEARML_LOG_ENVIRONMENT` with the variables you need track, either:

* All environment variables:

  ```
  export CLEARML_LOG_ENVIRONMENT="*"
  ```
    
* Specific environment variables, for example, log `PWD` and `PYTHONPATH`:

  ```
  export CLEARML_LOG_ENVIRONMENT="PWD,PYTHONPATH"
  ```
    
* No environment variables:

  ```
  export CLEARML_LOG_ENVIRONMENT=
  ```

## ClearML Hosted Service
        
**I run my script, but my experiment is not in the ClearML Hosted Service Web UI. How do I fix this?** <a id="hosted-service-no-config"></a>

If you joined the ClearML Hosted Service and run a script, but your experiment does not appear in Web UI, you may not have configured ClearML for the hosted service. Run the ClearML setup wizard. It will request your hosted service ClearML credentials and create the ClearML configuration you need.

    pip install clearml
    
    clearml-init

marks them as `aborted`. The watchdog is always active.

You can modify the following settings for the watchdog:
 
* The time threshold (in seconds) of task inactivity (default value is 7200 seconds which is 2 hours).
* The time interval (in seconds) between watchdog cycles.

For detailed instructions, see [Modifying non-responsive Task watchdog settings](deploying_clearml/clearml_server_config.md#non-responsive-task-watchdog) on the "Configuring Your Own ClearML Server" page.

## ClearML Server Troubleshooting

**I did a reinstall. Why can't I create credentials in the Web-App (UI)?** <a id="clearml-server-reinstall-cookies"></a>

The issue is likely your browser cookies for ClearML Server. Clearing your browser cookies for ClearML Server is recommended. 
For example: 
* For Firefox - go to Developer Tools > Storage > Cookies > delete all cookies under the ClearML Server URL.
* For Chrome - Developer Tools > Application > Cookies > delete all cookies under the ClearML Server URL.

<br/>

**How do I fix Docker upgrade errors?** <a id="common-docker-upgrade-errors"></a>

To resolve the Docker error:

`... The container name "/trains-???" is already in use by ...`

try removing deprecated images:

    $ docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)

<br/>

**Why is web login authentication not working?** <a className="tr_top_negative" id="port-conflict"></a>

A port conflict between the ClearML Server MongoDB and / or Elastic instances, and other instances running on your system may prevent web login authentication from working correctly. 

ClearML Server uses the following default ports which may be in conflict with other instances:

* MongoDB port `27017`
* Elastic port `9200`

You can check for port conflicts in the logs in `/opt/clearml/log`.

If a port conflict occurs, change the MongoDB and / or Elastic ports in the `docker-compose.yml`, and then run the Docker compose commands to restart the ClearML Server instance.

To change the MongoDB and / or Elastic ports for your ClearML Server, do the following:

1. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file.
1. Add the following environment variable(s) in the `services/trainsserver/environment` section:

    * For MongoDB:
    
        ```bash
        MONGODB_SERVICE_PORT: <new-mongodb-port>
        ```        
    
    * For Elastic:
    
        ```bash
        ELASTIC_SERVICE_PORT: <new-elasticsearch-port>
        ```         
    
        For example:
        
        ```bash
        MONGODB_SERVICE_PORT: 27018
        ELASTIC_SERVICE_PORT: 9201
        ```
    
1. For MongoDB, in the `services/mongo_4/ports` section, expose the new MongoDB port:

    ```bash
    <new-mongodb-port>:27017
    ```    
   
    For example:
    
    ```bash
    20718:27017
    ```
       
1. For Elastic, in the `services/elasticsearch/ports` section, expose the new Elastic port:

    ```bash
   <new-elasticsearch-port>:9200
   ```         
   
   For example:

   ```bash
   9201:9200
   ```
   
1. Restart ClearML Server, see [Restarting ClearML Server](#restart).

**How do I bypass a proxy configuration to access my local ClearML Server?** <a className="tr_top_negative" id="proxy-localhost"></a>

A proxy server may block access to ClearML Server configured for `localhost`.

To fix this, you may allow bypassing of your proxy server to `localhost` using a system environment variable, and configure ClearML for ClearML Server using it.

Do the following:

1. Allow bypassing of your proxy server to `localhost`
    using a system environment variable, for example:
    
        NO_PROXY = localhost

1. If a ClearML configuration file (`clearml.conf`) exists, delete it.
1. Open a terminal session.
1. Set the system environment variable to `127.0.0.1` in the terminal session. For example:
    
    * Linux:
    
        ```bash
        no_proxy=127.0.0.1
        NO_PROXY=127.0.0.1
        ```
   
    * Windows:
    
        ```bash
        set no_proxy=127.0.0.1
        set NO_PROXY=127.0.0.1
        ```
   
1. Run the ClearML wizard `clearml-init` to configure ClearML for ClearML Server, which will prompt you to open the ClearML Web UI at, [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/), and create new ClearML credentials.

    The wizard completes with:

        Verifying credentials ...
        Credentials verified!
        New configuration stored in /home/<username>/clearml.conf
        ClearML setup completed successfully.

<a className="tr_top_negative" id="elastic_watermark"></a>

<br/>

**The ClearML Server keeps returning HTTP 500 (or 400) errors. How do I fix this?** <a id="elastic_watermark"></a>

The ClearML Server will return HTTP error responses (5XX, or 4XX) when some of its [backend components](deploying_clearml/clearml_server.md) 
are failing. 

  
A common cause for such a failure is low available disk space, as the Elasticsearch service used by your server will go 
into read-only mode when it hits Elasticsearch flood watermark (by default, set to 95% disk space used).

This can be readily fixed by making more disk space available to the Elasticsearch service (either freeing up disk space 
disk, or if using dynamic cloud storage, increasing the disk size).

:::note
A likely indication of this situation can be determined by searching your clearml logs for *"\[FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only 
/ allow delete (api)]*".
:::

<br/>

**Why is my ClearML Web-App (UI) not showing any data?** <a className="tr_top_negative" id="web-ui-empty"></a>

If your ClearML Web-App (UI) does not show anything, it may be an error authenticating with the server. Try clearing the application cookies for the site in your browser's developer tools. 
    
**Why can't I access my ClearML Server when I run my code in a virtual machine?** <a id="vm_server"></a>

The network definitions inside a virtual machine (or container) are different from those of the host. The virtual machine's 
and the server machine's IP addresses are different, so you have to make sure that the machine that is executing the 
experiment can access the server's machine. 

Make sure to have an independent configuration file for the virtual machine where you are running your experiments. 
Edit the `api` section of your `clearml.conf` file and insert IP addresses of the server machine that are accessible 
from the VM. It should look something like this:

```
api {
    web_server: http://192.168.1.2:8080
    api_server: http://192.168.1.2:8008
    credentials {
        "access_key" = "KEY"
        "secret_key" = "SECRET"
    }
}
```



## ClearML Agent

**How can I execute ClearML Agent without installing packages each time?** <a className="tr_top_negative" id="system_site_packages"></a>

Instead of installing the Python packages in the virtual environment created by ClearML Agent, you can optimize execution 
time by inheriting the packages from your global site-packages directory. In the ClearML configuration file, set the 
configuration option `agent.package_manager.system_site_packages` to `true`.



## ClearML API

**How can I use the ClearML API to fetch data?** <a className="tr_top_negative" id="api"></a>

To fetch data using the ClearML API, create an authenticated session and send requests for data using the ClearML API 
services and methods. The responses to the requests contain your data.

For example, to get the metrics for an experiment and to print metrics as a histogram:

1. Start an authenticated session.
1. Send a request for all projects named `examples` using the `projects` service `GetAllRequest` method.
1. From the response, get the Ids of all those projects named `examples`.
1. Send a request for all experiments (tasks) with those project IDs using the `tasks` service `GetAllRequest` method.
1. From the response, get the data for the experiment (task) ID `11` and print the experiment name.
1. Send a request for a metrics histogram for experiment (task) ID `11` using the `events` service `ScalarMetricsIterHistogramRequest` method and print the histogram.

    ```python
    # Import Session from the clearml backend_api
    from clearml.backend_api import Session
    # Import the services for tasks, events, and projects
    from clearml.backend_api.services import tasks, events, projects
        
    # Create an authenticated session
    session = Session()
        
    # Get projects matching the project name 'examples'
    res = session.send(projects.GetAllRequest(name='examples'))
    # Get all the project Ids matching the project name 'examples"
    projects_id = [p.id for p in res.response.projects]
    print('project ids: {}'.format(projects_id))
        
    # Get all the experiments/tasks
    res = session.send(tasks.GetAllRequest(project=projects_id))
        
    # Do your work
    # For example, get the experiment whose ID is '11'
    task = res.response.tasks[11]
    print('task name: {}'.format(task.name))
        
    # For example, for experiment ID '11', get the experiment metric values
    res = session.send(events.ScalarMetricsIterHistogramRequest(
        task=task.id,
        )
   )
    scalars = res.response_data
    print('scalars {}'.format(scalars))
    ```
