Use the Dataset versioning WebApp (UI) features for viewing, creating, modifying, and 
deleting Dataset versions.

From the Datasets page, click on one of the Datasets in order to see and work with its versions. 

### Viewing Snapshots
    
View snapshots in the simple version structure using either:
        
* The simple view, a table of snapshots.

<details className="cml-expansion-panel screenshot">
<summary className="cml-expansion-panel-summary">Simple view (snapshot table)</summary>
<div className="cml-expansion-panel-content">

</div>
</details>
<br/>

* The advanced view, a tree of versions. The tree contains one version whose status is <i>Draft</i>, and snapshots appear in
chronological order, with oldest at the top, and the most recent at the bottom.
