title: Dataset Versions
---

Use the Dataset versioning WebApp (UI) features for viewing, creating, modifying, and 
deleting [Dataset versions](../dataset.md#dataset-versioning).

## Dataset Version History
The WebApp (UI) will present your dataset version structure in one of two ways, depending on the structure implemented.

## Simple View 
While your dataset maintains a simple (linear) [version structure](../dataset.md#dataset-version-structure), the WebApp 
(UI) will present the version history as a table of historic snapshots:

![image](../../img/hyperdatasets/web-app/dataset_simple_adv_01.png)

### Creating Snapshots

To create a snapshot, you must be in the simple (version table) view. 

**To create a snapshot, do the following:**

1. Click **+ CREATE SNAPSHOT**.
1. Enter a version name, and optionally a description.
1. Click **CREATE**.

:::note VERSION BROWSING
Snapshots are always taken of the current version. If you are currently viewing a previous snapshot, click 
**RETURN TO CURRENT VERSION** to make snapshot creation available.
:::

You can view your dataset’s explicit version structure and create a more complex structure by switching to the advanced 
view.

### Modifying Snapshot Name
To modify a Dataset version name:
1. Click the snapshot name on the top left of the dataset page
1. Edit the name,
1. Click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-save.svg" alt="check" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> (check).

        
## Advanced View

When employing a non-trivial [version structure](../dataset.md#dataset-version-structure) of your dataset, the WebApp 
(UI) presents the version history as a tree of versions.

### Creating Versions

**To create a child version, do the following:**

1. Click the (parent) version from which to create a child (inherit all frames).
1. Click **+ CREATE NEW VERSION**.
1. Enter a version name, and optionally a description.
1. Click **CREATE**.

### Publishing Versions

Publish (make read-only) any Dataset version whose status is *Draft*. If you publish a dataset's current version, the
dataset's structure will no longer be considered a simple version structure. 

**To publish a version, do the following:**

1. Click the version to publish.
1. Click **PUBLISH**.
1. Click **PUBLISH** again to confirm.

### Modifying Version Names

**To modify a Dataset version name:**
1. Click the dataset version name on the top left of the dataset page
1. Edit the name,
1. Click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-save.svg" alt="check" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> (check).

### Deleting Versions

You can delete versions whose status is *Draft*. 

1. Click the version to delete.
1. Click **DELETE**.
1. Click **DELETE** again to confirm.

## Version Information
Additional information about the selected dataset version is presented below the version selection panel in collapsible 
panels:

### Version Info Panel 
Provides general version information:
* Version ID 
* Dataset ID 
* Dataset name 
* Status (*Draft* or *Published*) 
* Creating user
* Version update time
* Version description.

**To modify a version description, do the following:**

1. Expand the **INFO** area 
1. Hover over the **Description** element
1. Click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-edit.svg" alt="Edit pencil" className="icon size-md space-sm" />
1. Edit the description
1. Click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-save.svg" alt="Check mark" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> (check)

### Version Metadata Panel 
Any version specific metadata, in JSON format.
The content icon color signifies whether any metadata is currently accompanying the dataset version.

**To edit a version's metadata:**

1. Click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-metadata.svg" alt="Edit metadata" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> on the 
   **VERSION METADATA** panel to open the edit window
1. Edit the section contents (JSON format)
1. Click **OK**

### Version Label Statistics Panel
Label usage stats for this dataset version. 
* Each label is listed along with the number of times it was used in the version
* The pie chart visualizes these stats. Hover over a chart slice and its associated label and usage 
  percentage will appear at the center of the chart. 
  
  
## Version Frame Browser
The **Version Frame Browser** displays a preview of the contents of the selected dataset version.
The dataset version can be filtered by multiple criteria. The resulting frames can be exported as a JSON file.  

To view further details about a specific frame, click on its preview, which will open the [Frame Viewer](webapp_datasets_frames.md#frame-viewer).

### Simple Frame Filtering
Simple frame filtering applies one annotation object (ROI) label and returns frames containing at least one annotation 
with that label. 

**To apply a simple frame filter,**  select a label from the **LABEL FILTER** list.

<details className="cml-expansion-panel screenshot">
<summary className="cml-expansion-panel-summary">Simple filter example</summary>
<div className="cml-expansion-panel-content">

* Before filtering, the **Version Browser** in the image below contains seven frames.

* A simple label filter for `person` shows three frames, each containing at least one ROI labeled `person`.

![Filtered version browser](../../img/hyperdatasets/frame_filtering_02.png)

</div>
</details>

### Advanced Frame Filtering

Advanced frame filtering applies sophisticated filtering logic, which is composed of as many frame filters as needed, 
where each frame filter can be a combination of ROI, frame, and source rules. 
* ROI rules use include and exclude logic to match frames by ROI label; an ROI label can match frames containing at least 
  one annotation object (ROI) with all labels in the rule.
* Frame rules and source rules use Lucene queries with AND, OR, and NOT logic. Frame rules apply to frame metadata.
* Source rules apply to frame source information.

**To apply advanced filters:**
1. In the **Version Browser**, click **Switch to advanced filters**.
1. In a **FRAME FILTER**, create one of the following rules:
    * ROI rule
        * Choose **Include** or **Exclude**, select ROI labels, and optionally set the confidence level range.
        * To switch from the ROI dropdown list to a Lucene query mode, click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-edit.svg" alt="Setting Gear" className="icon size-md space-sm" />.
    * Frame rule - Enter a Lucene query using frame metadata fields in the format `meta.<key>:<value>`.
    * Source rule - Enter a Lucene query using frame metadata fields in the format `sources.<key>:<value>`.            

#### Filtering Examples

<details className="cml-expansion-panel screenshot">
<summary className="cml-expansion-panel-summary">ROI Rules</summary>
<div className="cml-expansion-panel-content">      

* Create one ROI rule for `person` shows the same three frames as the simple frame filter (above).

![Adding an ROI rule](../../img/hyperdatasets/frame_filtering_03.png)

* In the ROI rule, add a second label. Add `partially_occluded`. Only frames containing at least one ROI labeled as both 
  `person` and `partially_occluded` match the filter.
  
![Add label to ROI rule](../../img/hyperdatasets/frame_filtering_04.png)
   
* By opening a frame in the frame viewer, you can see an ROI labeled with both.

### Exporting Frames

To export (download) filtered datasets as a JSON file, click **EXPORT FRAMES**. 

### Frame Browser Configuration
Click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-settings.svg" alt="Setting Gear" className="icon size-md" />  to open the
frame browser configuration settings. 

#### Grouping Previews
FrameGroups or SingleFrames can share the same `context_id` (URL). For example, users can set the same `context_id` 
to multiple FrameGroups that represent frames in a single video. 

Use the **Grouping** menu to select one of the following options:
* Split Preview - Show separate previews for each individual FrameGroup, regardless of shared context.
* Group by URL - Show a single preview for all FrameGroups with the same context   

#### Preview Source
When using multi-source FrameGroups, users can choose which of the FrameGroups’ sources will be displayed as the preview. 

Select a source from the **PREVIEW SOURCE** menu.
Choose the `Default preview source` option to present the first available source.

:::note Unavailable Source
If a FrameGroup doesn't have the selected preview source, the preview displays the "Source not available" message.
