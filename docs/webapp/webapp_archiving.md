Archive experiments and models to improve the organization of active work. Archived experiments and models do not appear
in the active (main) experiments and models tables. They only appear in the archive. Experiments can be restored from the
archive.

When archiving an experiment:

* If it is enqueued to execute (its status is *Pending*), the experiment is automatically dequeued (its status becomes
  *Draft*).
* If it is shared (**ClearML Hosted Service** only), the experiment becomes private.

    * Experiments or models table - Right click the experiment or model **>** **Archive**.
