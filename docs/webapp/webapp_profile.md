![Workspace configuration page](../img/settings_workspace_configuration.png)

### ClearML Credentials

Generate ClearML credentials, made up of an access and secret key pair, and insert them into your [configuration file](../configs/clearml_conf.md) 
to grant the ClearML SDK and the ClearML Agent API access to the server. 

You can create credentials for any workspace that you are a member of. 

**To create ClearML credentials:**

1. In **WORKSPACE**, expand the desired workspace's panel (self-deployed ClearML Server users have one workspace)

1. In **App Credentials**, click **+ Create new credentials**

1. In the dialog that pops up, you can input a label for the new credentials 

The dialog displays new credentials, formatted as a ready-to-copy configuration file section (including server configuration 
information).

### Changing Your Workspace Name
To change the name of your own workspace, click **Edit workspace name**  <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-edit.svg" alt="Edit Pencil" className="icon size-md" /> 
(under App credentials) **>** modify the name **>** click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-save.svg" alt="Check Mark" className="icon size-md" />.

pending invitations are displayed. 

### Leaving a Workspace

You can leave any workspace you’ve previously joined (except your personal workspace).

When leaving a workspace, you lose access to its resources (tasks, models, etc.) and your previously created access 
credentials to that workspace are revoked. Tasks and associated artifacts that you logged to that workspace will remain 
in that workspace. You can rejoin the workspace only if you are re-invited.

1. In **Members** **>** Click **LEAVE WORKSPACE**.


### Configuration Vault

:::note Enterprise Feature
This feature is available under the ClearML Enterprise plan
:::

Use the configuration vault to store global ClearML configuration entries that can extend the ClearML [configuration file](../configs/clearml_conf.md) 
of any ClearML Agents or the ClearML SDK running with your credentials. Productivity tip: Keep the vault disabled while 
you edit your configuration, and enable it when the configuration is ready.

New entries will extend the configuration in the ClearML [configuration file](../configs/clearml_conf.md), and existing 
file entries will be overridden by the vault values.

Fill in values using any of ClearML supported configuration formats: HOCON / JSON / YAML.

**To edit vault contents:**
1. Click **EDIT** or double click the vault box
1. Insert / edit the configurations in the vault 
1. Press **OK**

**To apply vault contents:**

* Once enabled, the configurations will be merged to the configuration file during ClearML and ClearML Agent usage 

## Users & Groups  

ClearML Hosted Service users can add users to their workspace.

:::note Hosted Service Feature
Inviting new teammates is only available on the ClearML Hosted Service
:::

### Users
The **USERS** table lists workspace members and shows whether the maximum number of members has been reached. 
Each row of the table includes: 
* Username 
* User status (`Active` or `Pending`) 
* If the user's invitation is pending, the date the user was added
* [User groups](#user-groups) (ClearML Enterprise feature)

#### Inviting New Teammates

To remove a user from a workspace:
1. Hover over the user's row on the table
1. Click the <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-trash.svg" alt="Trash can" className="icon size-md" /> button

Removed users lose access to your workspace’s resources (tasks, models, etc.) and their existing access credentials are 
revoked. Tasks and associated artifacts logged to your workspace by a removed user will remain in your workspace. The 
user can only rejoin your workspace when you re-invite them. 

### User Groups

:::important Enterprise Feature
This feature is available under the ClearML Enterprise plan, as part of the [Access Rules](#access-rules) 
feature.
:::

Administrators can define user groups, which can be used for access privilege management. Users can be assigned to 
multiple user groups.

The system includes three pre-configured groups that can't be removed: 
* `Users` - All users. Can't be modified
* `Admins` - Have RW access to all resources (except queue modification), and can grant users / user groups access 
  permissions to workspace resources
* `Queue admins` -  Can create / delete / rename queues

The user group table lists all the active user groups. Each row includes a group's name, description, and member list. 

![User Management Page](../img/settings_user_management_table.png)

#### To create a user group:
1. Click **+ ADD GROUP**
1. In the dialog, add a group name and description
1. Add members to the group. When clicking the input box, a list of workspace members appears, from which group members 
   can be selected. Filter the list by typing part of the username. To remove a member, Hover over a user's row and click 
   the <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-trash.svg" alt="Trash can" className="icon size-md" /> button
1. Click **SAVE**

![User group creation dialog](../img/settings_user_group.png)

#### To edit a user group:
1. Hover over the user group's row on the table
1. Click the <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-edit.svg" alt="Edit Pencil" className="icon size-md" /> button
1. Edit the group's name and / or description
1. Edit group members (see details [here](#to-create-a-user-group))
1. Click **Save**

#### To delete a user group:
1. Hover over the user group's row on the table
1. Click the <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-trash.svg" alt="Trash can" className="icon size-md" /> button

When a user group is deleted, its members will lose the access privileges that had been granted to the group (unless 
otherwise provided individually or to another group they are members of). 

## Access Rules

:::important Enterprise Feature 
This feature is available under the ClearML Enterprise plan
:::

Workspace administrators can use the **Access Rules** page to manage workspace permissions, by specifying which users 
and / or user groups have access permissions to the following workspace resources:
 
* [Projects](../fundamentals/projects.md)
* [Tasks](../fundamentals/task.md) 
* [Models](../fundamentals/artifacts.md#models)
* [Dataviews](../hyperdatasets/dataviews.md) 
* [Datasets](../hyperdatasets/dataset.md)
* [Queues](../fundamentals/agents_and_queues.md#what-is-a-queue) 

By default, all users have **READ & MODIFY** access to all resources.

### Creating Access Rules
Access privileges can be viewed, defined, and edited in the **Access Rules** table. 

1. Click **+ ADD RULES** to access the rule creation dialog
1. Select the resource to grant privileges to. To select a specific resource object (e.g. a 
   specific project or task), click the input box, and select the object from the list that appears. Filter the 
   list by typing part of the desired object name
1. Select the permission type - **Read Only** or **Read & Modify**
1. Assign users and / or [user groups](#user-groups) to be given access. Click the desired input box, and select the 
   users / groups from the list that appears. Filter the list by typing part of the desired object name. To revoke 
   access, hover over a user's or group's row and click the <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-trash.svg" alt="Trash can" className="icon size-md" /> 
   button
1. Click **SAVE**

![Access rule creation dialog](../img/settings_access_rules.png)

Access is inherited according to resource hierarchy. For example, if a user is given access to a project, the user will 
also have access to the project's contents (tasks, models, etc.). A user who is granted access to a specific task will 
not have access to another task in the project, unless explicitly granted.  

### Editing Access Rules
1. Hover over the access rule's row on the table
1. Click the <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-edit.svg" alt="Edit Pencil" className="icon size-md" /> button
1. Change the resource, resource object, and permission type as desired
1. Edit access rule users / groups (see details [here](#creating-access-rules))
1. Click **SAVE**

### Deleting Access Rules
1. Hover over the access rule's row on the **Access Rules** table
1. Click the <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-trash.svg" alt="Trash can" className="icon size-md" /> button

All users and access groups who had been assigned to the deleted access rule, will lose the access privileges granted by
that rule (unless otherwise provided by a different rule)

### Filtering Access Rules Table

The access rules table can be filtered by resource type and by target resource and users / groups. 
* **To filter by resource**, click the **View** dropdown menu and select the desired resource
* **To filter by target resource or users / groups**, click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-filter-off.svg" alt="Filter" className="icon size-md" />
on the respective column and select the users / groups to view from the list that appears.
