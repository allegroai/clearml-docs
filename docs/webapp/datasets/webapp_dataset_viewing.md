:::tip SDK version compatibility
The datasets page shows datasets created with `clearml` v1.6 or newer.  
Datasets created with earlier versions of `clearml` are available in their original project.  
:::

The dataset page lists the dataset's versions. For a selected version, the **Dataset Version Panel** shows its lineage 
in graph form. 

![Dataset lineage](../../img/webapp_dataset_lineage.png)

Each node in the graph represents a dataset version, and shows the following details:

<div class="max-w-50">

* Version name and number
* Version size 
* Version update time
* Version details button - Hover over the version and click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-console.svg" alt="console" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
  to view the version's [details panel](#version-details-panel) 
  
:::tip archiving versions
You can archive dataset versions so the versions list doesn't get too cluttered. Click **OPEN ARCHIVE** on the top of 
the list to open the archive and view all archived versions. From the archive, you can restore 
versions to remove them from the archive. You can also permanently delete versions.

:::tip Download Version List
You can download the dataset version list as a CSV file by clicking <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-download.svg" alt="Download" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
and choosing one of these options:
* **Download onscreen items** - Download the values for versions currently visible on screen  
* **Download all items** - Download the values for all versions in this dataset that match the current active filters  

The downloaded data consists of the currently displayed table columns.
