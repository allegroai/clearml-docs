:::tip SDK version compatibility
The datasets page shows datasets created with `clearml` v1.6 or newer.  
Datasets created with earlier versions of `clearml` are available in their original project.

The dataset page lists the dataset's versions. For a selected version, the **Dataset Version Panel** shoes its lineage 
in graph form.

|Delete| Delete an archived version and its artifacts. This action is available only from the dataset’s archive |

![Dataset actions](../../img/webapp_dataset_actions.png)

The actions mentioned in the chart above can be performed on multiple versions at once. [Select multiple versions](#selecting-multiple-versions), 
then use either the context menu, or the bar that appears at the bottom of the page, to perform operations on the 
selected versions.

## Selecting Multiple Versions
