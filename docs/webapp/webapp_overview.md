## UI Modules 
The WebApp's sidebar provides access to the following modules:
* [Dashboard](webapp_home.md) <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-homepage.svg" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> - 
  The dashboard for recent activity and quick access to experiments and projects.
* [Projects](webapp_projects_page.md) <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-projects.svg" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> - 
  The main experimentation page. Access your experiments and models as they are organized into projects.
  The [experiments](webapp_exp_table.md) and [models](webapp_model_table.md) are displayed in tables
  which let you:
    * [Track ongoing experiments and visualize their results](webapp_exp_track_visual.md)
    * [Reproduce previously run experiments](webapp_exp_reproducing.md)
    * [Tune experiments with no code change](webapp_exp_tuning.md)
    * [Compare experiments](webapp_exp_comparing.md)
    * [Share experiments and their models](webapp_exp_sharing.md) with other ClearML hosted service users 
* [Datasets](datasets/webapp_dataset_page.md) <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-side-bar-datasets.svg" alt="Datasets" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> - View and manage your datasets. 
* [Pipelines](pipelines/webapp_pipeline_page.md) <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-pipelines.svg" alt="Pipelines" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> - View and manage your pipelines.
* [Reports](webapp_reports.md) <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-reports.svg" alt="Reports" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> - View and manage your reports.
* [Orchestration](webapp_workers_queues.md) <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-workers.svg" alt="Workers and Queues" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> - Scale, monitor, and manage your resource usage and workers queues.
* [Applications](applications/apps_overview.md) <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-applications.svg" alt="ClearML Apps" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> - ClearML's GUI applications for no-code workflow execution.

## UI Top Bar 
### Settings Menu

Click the profile menu button <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-me.svg" alt="Profile button" className="icon size-lg space-sm" />
in the top right corner of the web UI screen to access the following:
* **Settings** - Navigate to ClearML's user [Settings](webapp_profile.md) page:
  * Set WebApp preferences
  * Manage workspace API credentials
  * Configure Cloud Storage Access credentials for the ClearML Web UI
  * ClearML Hosted service specific options
    * View usage information
    * Manage users and workspaces
    * Manage resource access permissions (available in the ClearML Enterprise plan)
* **Invite a User** to your workspace (supported in hosted service). Click **Invite a User** > input user's 
email > click **ADD** > page redirects to the [Users & Groups](webapp_profile.md#users--groups) section of 
  the **Settings** page 
* **Switch to Workspace** - Hosted service users can be members of multiple workspaces. These workspaces are listed here. 
  Click a workspace to switch to.
* **Logout** of ClearML 

### Finding What You're Looking for
Use the search bar <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-search.svg" alt="Magnifying glass" className="icon size-md space-sm" />
to find your ClearML resources.

To search using regex, click the `.*` icon on the search bar. 

Search results are returned for the different ClearML objects:
* Experiments - Searching an experiment table looks for matches in the experiments' name, ID, description and input and 
output models. The enterprise version also includes experiment Dataviews' hyper-datasets and versions. 
* Models - Searching a Model table looks for matches in the models' name, ID and description.
* Dataviews (Enterprise only) - Searching a Dataviews table looks for matches in the Dataviews' name, ID, description, 
hyper-datasets, and versions.
* Datasets - Searching the datasets page looks for matches in the datasets' name, ID, and description. In a dataset's
version table, a search looks for matches in the versions' name, ID, and description. 
* Pipelines - Searching the pipelines page looks for matches in the datasets' name, ID, and description. In a pipeline
run's table, a search looks for matches in the runs' name and ID. 
* Reports - Searching the reports page looks for matches in the reports' name, ID, tags, project, description, and 
report content.

The search bar in the [Dashboard](webapp_home.md) page searches the whole WebApp for objects that match queries as 
specified above and returns results divided by object type (projects, experiments, models, etc.). 

:::tip Additional filtering
ClearML's object tables (e.g. [experiments](webapp_exp_table.md), [models](webapp_model_table.md), [pipelines](pipelines/webapp_pipeline_table.md), 
and [datasets](datasets/webapp_dataset_page.md)) provide column filters to easily focus your search by object properties
(e.g status, creation/update time, metric values, etc.).
