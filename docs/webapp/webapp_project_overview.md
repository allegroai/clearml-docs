title: Project Overview
---

Every project has an editable markdown file in its **OVERVIEW** tab. The overview is a sort of 
scratchpad where you can write and share reports, reference specific experiments, connect to project management 
tickets from external services, and anything else related to the project.

## Metric snapshot

On the top of the **OVERVIEW** tab, there is an option to create a **metric snapshot**. Choose a metric and variant, 
and then the window will display an aggregated view of the value for the specified metric in all completed experiments 
over time. This way, the project's progress can be quickly deduced.

All completed project experiments that measured the specified metric show up in the snapshot. Hover over a point in the snapshot, 
and a box will appear with information about the experiment associated with the metric. Click the point, and you will 
be sent to the associated experiment's page.
