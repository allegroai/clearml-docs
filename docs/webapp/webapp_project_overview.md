title: Project Overview
---

Every project has an editable markdown project overview file in the project's **Overview** tab. The overview is a sort of 
scratchpad where you can write and share reports, reference specific experiments, connect to project management 
tickets from external service, and anything else related to the project.

## Metric snapshot

On the top of the **Overview** tab, there is an option to open a metric snapshot. Choose a metric and variant, 
and then the metric snapshot will display an aggregated view of all completed project experiments value for the specified 
metric over time. This way, you can quickly deduce how the project is progressing.

All completed experiments that measured the specified metric show up in the snapshot. Hover over a point in the snapshot, 
and a box will appear with information about the experiment associated with the metric. If you click the point, you will 
be sent to the associated experiment's page.
