title: Model Endpoints 
---

The Model Endpoints table lists all currently live (active, and being brought up) model endpoints, allowing you to view 
endpoint details and monitor status over time. Whenever you deploy a model through the [ClearML Deploy UI applications](applications/apps_overview.md#deploy), 
it will be listed in the table. 

View the model endpoints in table view img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-table-view.svg" alt="Table view" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
or in details view <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-split-view.svg" alt="Details view" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
using the buttons on the top left of the page. Use the table view for a comparative view of your endpoints according to 
columns of interest. Use the details view to access a selected endpoint's details. Details view can also be accessed by 
double-clicking a specific endpoint in the table view to open its details view.

Download the model endpoint table as a CSV file by clicking **Download** <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-download.svg" alt="Download" className="icon size-sm space-sm" />.

## Endpoint Tables

Active Endpoints are displayed in the **Active** tab. The table provides the following information: 
* Endpoint - Endpoint name
* Model  - Model Name
* URL - Endpoint URL
* \# Instances - Number of model instances
* Uptime - Longest duration that any of the model instances has been running
* \# Requests - Total number of requests to the endpoint
* Requests / MIN (avg) - Average request rate in the last minute
* Latency (avg) - Average endpoint response latency

The **Loading** tab shows endpoints that are being set up, but are not yet active. The table provides the following 
information:

* Instance ID - The model deployment application instance ID
* Model - Model Name
* Uptime - Time since this endpoint has started setting up
* Preprocess artifact - Preprocessing code used for the endpoint 
* Input type - Model matrix input type  (e.g. uint8, float32, int16, float16)
* Input size - Model matrix input size `[Rows x Columns X Channels etc ...]`

You can apply column filters by clicking <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-filter-off.svg" alt="Filter" className="icon size-md" />, 
and sort endpoints by clicking <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-sort-off.svg" alt="Sort order" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> on the relevant column.

## Active Endpoint Details 
Clicking on a model endpoint opens it in detailed view.

### Details

The **Details** tab displays the model endpoint information: 
* Endpoint Name
* Endpoint URL
* Model name (click to go to ClearML or HuggingFace model page)
* Uptime - Duration of longest running endpoint instance
* Preprocess artifact - Preprocessing code used for the endpoint 
* Input type - Model matrix input type  (e.g. uint8, float32, int16, float16)
* Input size - Model matrix input size `[Rows x Columns X Channels etc ...]`
* Model instances list - Model instances servicing the endpoint. The following information is displayed for each instance:
  * Instance ID - Click instance ID to go to the model endpoint's ClearML Application instance dashboard .
  * Uptime
  * Number of requests - Total count
  * Request rate - Average requests per minute
  * CPU Count
  * GPU Count 
  * Latency - Average request latency in the last minute

### Monitor
The Monitor tab displays the endpoint's operational metrics and resource usage over time graphs: 
* Total number of requests 
* Average requests/min 
* Average latency 
* Machine utilization metrics:
  * CPU and GPU Usage
  * Memory Usage 
  * Video Memory Usage
  * Network Usage

The graphs' time span can be controlled through the menu at its top right corner. 
Click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-show.svg" alt="Eye Show" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> to control which 
plots to display. Click **HIDE ALL**, and then click <icon> on the plots you want to see.
