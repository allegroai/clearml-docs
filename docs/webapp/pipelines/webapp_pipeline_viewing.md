title: Pipeline Run Details
---

The run details panel shows the pipeline's structure and the execution status of every step, as well as the run's 
configuration parameters and output. 

![Pipeline structure](../../img/webapp_pipeline_DAG.png#light-mode-only)
![Pipeline structure](../../img/webapp_pipeline_DAG_dark.png#dark-mode-only)

Each step shows: 

![Pipeline step info](../../img/webapp_pipeline_node.png#light-mode-only)
![Pipeline step info](../../img/webapp_pipeline_node_dark.png#dark-mode-only)

* Step name
* Step status
* Step execution time
* Step log button - Hover over the step and click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-console.svg" alt="console" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
  to view the step's [details panel](#run-and-step-details-panel) 

While the pipeline is running, the steps' details and colors are updated.

## Run Stages
Steps that were set into the same stage when created, are grouped into stages in the Run Details panel. 

In stages view, click`Expand Stages` to view the complete pipeline DAG with all steps visible. 
In the detailed view, click `Collapse Stages` to view the pipeline DAG outline with the same stage steps grouped into a single stage.

In the collapsed view, each stage displays:

<div class="max-w-25"> 

![Pipeline stage card](../../img/webapp_pipeline_stage_card.png)

</div>

* Stage name 
* Number of steps in stage 

Click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-zoom-to-fit.svg" alt="Expand" className="icon size-md space-md" /> to view the 
steps that comprise the stage. Select a step to view its [Step Info](#run-and-step-info).

Click on a stage to view its **STAGE INFO**:

<div class="max-w-50"> 

![Pipeline stage info](../../img/webapp_pipeline_stage_info.png)

</div> 

* Stage name
* Step count by status - The number of steps in each status category (e.g. completed, running, pending)


## Run and Step Details
### Run and Step Info

On the pipeline run panel, view the **RUN INFO** which shows: 
* Run Parameters 
* Reported Metrics
* Produced Artifacts 
* Output Models 

![Run info](../../img/webapp_pipeline_run_info.png#light-mode-only)
![Run info](../../img/webapp_pipeline_run_info_dark.png#dark-mode-only)

To view a run's complete information, click **Full details**, which will open the pipeline's controller [task page](../webapp_exp_track_visual.md). 
View each list's complete details in the pipeline task's corresponding tabs: 
* **PARAMETERS** list > **CONFIGURATION** tab
* **METRICS** list > **SCALARS** tab
* **ARTIFACTS** and **MODELS** lists > **ARTIFACTS** tab 

![Pipeline task info](../../img/webapp_pipeline_task_info.png#light-mode-only)
![Pipeline task info](../../img/webapp_pipeline_task_info_dark.png#dark-mode-only)

To view a specific step's information, click the step on the execution graph, and the info panel displays its **STEP INFO**. 
The panel displays the step's name, task type, and status, as well as its parameters, metrics, artifacts, and models. 

![Step info](../../img/webapp_pipeline_step_info.png#light-mode-only)
![Step info](../../img/webapp_pipeline_step_info_dark.png#dark-mode-only)

To return to viewing the run's information, click the pipeline graph, outside any of the steps.  

### Run and Step Details Panel

Click on **DETAILS** on the top left of the info panel to view the pipeline controller's details panel. To view a step's 
details panel, click **DETAILS** and then click on a step node, or hover over a step node and click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-console.svg" alt="details" className="icon size-md space-sm" />.

The details panel includes three tabs: 
* **Preview** - View debug samples and plots attached to the pipeline controller or step 

  ![preview](../../img/webapp_pipeline_step_debug.png#light-mode-only)
  ![preview](../../img/webapp_pipeline_step_debug_dark.png#dark-mode-only)

* **Console** - The console log for the pipeline controller or steps: contains everything printed to stdout and stderr.  

  ![console](../../img/webapp_pipeline_step_console.png#light-mode-only)
  ![console](../../img/webapp_pipeline_step_console_dark.png#dark-mode-only)

* **Code** - For pipeline steps generated from functions using either [`PipelineController.add_function_step`](../../references/sdk/automation_controller_pipelinecontroller.md#add_function_step)
or [`PipelineDecorator.component`](../../references/sdk/automation_controller_pipelinecontroller.md#pipelinedecoratorcomponent), 
you can view the selected step's code.
