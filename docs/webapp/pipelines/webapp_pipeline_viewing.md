For pipelines steps generated from functions using either [`PipelineController.add_function_step`](../../references/sdk/automation_controller_pipelinecontroller.md#add_function_step)
or [`PipelineDecorator.component`](../../references/sdk/automation_controller_pipelinecontroller.md##pipelinedecoratorcomponent), 
you can also view the selected step’s code. On the top center 
of the console panel, click **Code**.
