title: Comparing Experiments
---
It is always useful to investigate what causes an experiment to succeed.
The **ClearML Web UI** provides a deep experiment comparison, allowing to locate, visualize, and analyze differences including:

* [Details](#details)
    - [Artifacts](#artifacts) - Input model, output model, and model design.
    - [Execution](#execution-details) - Installed packages and source code.
    - [Configuration](#configuration) - Configuration objects used by the experiment.
* [Hyperparameters](#hyperparameters)
    - [Values (table) view](#values-mode) - Key/value of all the arguments used by the experiments.
    - [Parallel coordinates view](#parallel-coordinates-mode) - Impact of each argument on a selected metric
      the experiments reported (see [task.connect_configuration](../references/sdk/task.md#connect_configuration)).
* [Scalars](#scalars)
    - Specific values and plots of scalar series (see [reporting scalars](../guides/reporting/scalar_reporting.md) / [automatic reporting](../fundamentals/logger.md#automatic-reporting))
* [Plots](#plots)
    - Plots are combined to have multiple lines from different experiments (for example multiple RoC curves laid on top
      of each other).
* [Debug samples](#debug-samples)
    - Debug samples by each iteration
    - Examine samples with a viewer (for images and video), and a player (for audio) (see [reporting media](../guides/reporting/media_reporting.md)).


The ClearML experiment comparison provides [comparison features](#comparison-features) making it easy to compare experiments.

## Selecting Experiments to Compare

**To select experiments to compare:**

1. Go to an experiments table, which includes the experiments to be compared.
1. Select the experiments to compare, select the checkboxes individually or select the top checkbox for all experiments. After selecting the second checkbox, a bottom bar appears.
1. In the bottom bar, click **COMPARE**. The comparison page appears, showing a column for each experiment and differences with a highlighted background color. The experiment on the left is the base experiment. Other experiments compare to the base experiment.


## Details

The **DETAILS** tab includes deep comparisons of the following:

### Artifacts

   * Input model and model configuration.
   * Output model and model configuration.
   * Other artifacts, if any.

### Execution Details
   * The Source code - repository, branch, commit ID, script file name, and working directory.
   * Uncommitted changes, sorted by file name.
   * Installed Python packages and versions, sorted by package name.

### Configuration
   * Configuration objects used by the experiment (see [configuration objects](../fundamentals/hyperparameters.md#connecting-objects)),
sorted by sections.


### To Locate the Source Differences:

* Click the **DETAILS** tab **>** Expand highlighted sections, or, in the header, click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-previous-diff.svg" alt="Up arrow" className="icon size-md" />
  (Previous diff) or <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-next-diff.svg" alt="Down arrow" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> (Next diff).

For example, in the image below, expanding **ARTIFACTS** **>** **Output Model** **>** **Model** shows that the model ID
and name are different.

## Hyperparameters

Compare hyperparameters as values, or compare by metric (hyperparameter parallel coordinate comparison).

### Values Mode

The Values mode is a side-by-side comparison that shows hyperparameter value differences highlighted line-by-line.

**To view a side by side values comparison:**

1. Click the **HYPER PARAMETERS** tab.
1. In the dropdown menu (on the upper left, next to **+ Add Experiments**), choose **Values**.
1. To show only differences, move the **Hide Identical Fields** slider to on.
1. Locate differences by either:
    * Clicking <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-previous-diff.svg" alt="Up arrow" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> (Previous diff) or
      <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-next-diff.svg" alt="Down arrow" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> (Next diff).
    * Scrolling to see highlighted hyperparameters.

For example, expanding **General** shows that the `batch_size` and `epochs` differ between the experiments.

### Parallel Coordinates Mode

In the Parallel Coordinates mode, compare a metric to any combination of hyperparameters using a parallel coordinates plot.

**To compare by metric:**

1. Click the **HYPER PARAMETERS** tab.
1. In the dropdown menu (on the upper left, next to **+ Add Experiments**), choose **Parallel Coordinates**.
1. In **Performance Metric**, expand a metric or monitored resource, and then click a variant.
1. Select the metric values to use. Choose one of the following:
    * **LAST** - The final value, or the most recent value, for in-progress experiments.
    * **MIN** - Minimal value.
    * **MAX** - Maximal value.
1. In **Parameters**, select the hyperparameter checkboxes to compare.
1. To view one experiment on the plot, hover over the experiment name in the legend.

For example, plot the metric/variant `epoch_accuracy`/`validation: epoch_accuracy` against the hyperparameters
`batch_size` and `epochs`.

## Scalars

Visualize the comparison of scalars, which includes metrics and monitored resources in the **SCALARS** tab.

### Compare Specific Values

**To compare specific values:**

1. Click the **SCALARS** tab.
1. In the dropdown menu (upper right of the left sidebar), choose either:
    * **Last Values** (the final or most recent value)
    * **Min Values** (the minimal values)
    * **Max Values** (the maximal values)
1. Sort by variant.

### Compare Scalar Series

Compare scalar series in plots and analyze differences using **ClearML Web UI** plot tools.

**To compare scalar series:**

1. Click the **SCALARS** tab.
1. In the dropdown menu (upper right of the left sidebar), choose **Graph**.

**To improve scalar series analysis:**

* In **Group by**, select one of these option:
  * **Metric** - all variants for a metric on the same plot.
  * **Metric+Variant** - every variant appears on its own plot.
* Horizontal axis options:
  * Iterations,
  * Relative time since the experiment began,
  * Wall (clock time).
* Smooth a curve - move the **Smoothing** slider or type in a smoothing number from **0** to **0.999**.
* Use plot controls, which appear when you hover over the top of a plot.
* Hide / show scalar plots - Click **Hide all** and <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-show.svg" alt="Eye Show All" className="icon size-md space-sm" />.
* Filter scalars by full or partial scalar name.

This image shows scalars grouped by metric.
