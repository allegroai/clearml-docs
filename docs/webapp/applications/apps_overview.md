Configure and launch app instances, then track their execution from the app dashboard.

ClearML provides applications in a range of categories to enhance your workflows: 

### General
Applications for automating and optimizing workflows, and monitoring project performance:
* [**Hyperparameter Optimization**](apps_hpo.md) - Find the parameter values that yield the best performing models
* **Nvidia Clara** - Train models using Nvidia's Clara framework
* [**Project Dashboard**](apps_dashboard.md) - High-level project monitoring with Slack alerts
* [**Task Scheduler**](apps_task_scheduler.md) - Schedule tasks for one-shot and/or periodic execution at specified times (available under ClearML Enterprise Plan)
* [**Trigger Manager**](apps_trigger_manager.md) - Define tasks to be run when predefined events occur (available under ClearML Enterprise Plan)

detached interactive SSH session (available under ClearML Enterprise Plan)
* [**Jupyter Lab**](apps_jupyter_lab.md) - Launch a Jupyter Lab session on a remote machine (available under ClearML Enterprise Plan)
* [**VS Code**](apps_vscode.md) - Launch a VS Code session on a remote machine (available under ClearML Enterprise Plan)

### UI Dev
Applications for deploying user interfaces for models:
* [**Gradio Launcher**](apps_gradio.md) - Create visual web interfaces for your models with Gradio (available under ClearML Enterprise Plan)
* [**Streamlit Launcher**](apps_streamlit.md) - Create visual web interfaces for your models with Streamlit (available under ClearML Enterprise Plan)

### Deploy
Applications for deploying machine learning models as scalable, secure services:
* [**Embedding Model Deployment**](apps_embed_model_deployment.md) - Deploy embedding models as networking services over a secure endpoint (available under ClearML Enterprise Plan)
* [**Model Deployment**](apps_model_deployment.md) - Deploy LLM models as networking services over a secure endpoint (available under ClearML Enterprise Plan)
* [**llama.cpp**](apps_llama_deployment.md) - Deploy LLM models in GGUF format using [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) as networking services over a secure endpoint (available under ClearML Enterprise Plan)

:::info Autoscalers
Autoscaling ([AWS Autoscaler](apps_aws_autoscaler.md) and [GCP Autoscaler](apps_gcp_autoscaler.md))
was previously available through the Applications page. The autoscaler functionality has been moved to the [Orchestration page](https://app.clear.ml/workers-and-queues/autoscalers) 
in the WebApp.

## App Pages Layout
Each application's page is split into two sections:
* App Instance List - Launch new app instances and view previously launched instances. Click on an instance to view its 
  dashboard. Hover over it to access the [app instance actions](#app-instance-actions).
* App Instance Dashboard - The main section of the app page: displays the selected app instance's status and results.
  Use the search bar <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-search.svg" alt="Magnifying glass" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
  to quickly find an app instance by name.

## Launching an App Instance

1. Choose the desired app
1. Click `Launch New` <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-add.svg" alt="Add new" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> to open the app's configuration form
1. Fill in the configuration details
1. **Launch**

:::tip Configuration shortcuts
You can also launch an app instance with the configuration of a previously launched instance:
* Cloning a previously launched app instance will open the instance launch form with the original instance's configuration 
  prefilled.
* Importing an app configuration file. You can export an existing app instance's configuration as a JSON file when 
  viewing its configuration.

The prefilled instance launch form can be edited before starting the new app instance. 
:::
  
## App Instance Actions
Access app instance actions, by right-clicking an instance, or through the menu button <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-dots-v-menu.svg" alt="Dot menu" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> (available on hover).

<div class="max-w-75">

![App context menu](../../img/app_context_menu.png#light-mode-only)
![App context menu](../../img/app_context_menu_dark.png#dark-mode-only)

</div>

* **Rename** - Rename the instance 
* **Configuration** - View an instance's configuration 
* **Export Configuration** - Export the app instance configuration as a JSON file, which you can later import to create 
  a new instance with the same configuration   
* **Stop** - Shutdown the instance
* **Clone** - Launch a new instance with same configuration prefilled
* **Delete** - Delete the instance

## Instance List Actions 

Access the instance list actions by clicking the action menu (<img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-dots-v-menu.svg" alt="Dot menu" className="icon size-md space-sm" />) 
on the instance list header:

<div class="max-w-75">

![Instance list actions](../../img/apps_instance_list_actions.png#light-mode-only)
![Instance list actions](../../img/apps_instance_list_actions_dark.png#dark-mode-only)

</div>

* **Import Configuration** - Import an app instance's configuration file. This opens the app instance launch form
  prefilled according to the imported file. You can modify the configuration before launching the instance.  

* **Clear Completed** - Delete all app instances that have completed their execution. This action only 
deletes instances in the current instance list view (i.e. My instances / All).
