title: Gradio Launcher
---

:::info Enterprise Feature
The Gradio Launcher App is available under the ClearML Enterprise plan.
:::

[Gradio](https://gradio.app/) is a framework for creating visual web interfaces for your models. The ClearML Gradio 
launcher application spins up a Gradio execution environment and serves your Gradio app on a machine of your choice. 
Once you start a Gradio launcher instance, you will be provided with an [externally accessible link](#traffic_router) to 
your Gradio app, where you can make use of your models.

The Gradio launcher monitors the Gradio app activity and shuts down if it is inactive for a specified maximum idle time.

:::important AI Application Gateway
The Gradio Launcher relies on the ClearML Traffic Router which implements user authentication, and redirects requests 
to the IP/port served by the Gradio app. 

If the ClearML AI application Gateway is not available, the Gradio app might not be accessible.
:::

Once you start a Gradio launcher instance, you can view the following information in its dashboard:

## Gradio Launcher Instance Configuration
When configuring a new Gradio launcher instance, you can fill in the required parameters or reuse the configuration of 
a previously launched instance.  

Launch an app instance with the configuration of a previously launched instance using one of the following options:
* Cloning a previously launched app instance will open the instance launch form with the original instance's 
configuration prefilled.
* Importing an app configuration file. You can export the configuration of a previously launched instance as a JSON file 
when viewing its configuration.

The prefilled instance launch form can be edited before starting the new app instance. 

To configure a new app instance, click `Launch New` <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-add.svg" alt="Add new" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
to open the app's instance launch form.
