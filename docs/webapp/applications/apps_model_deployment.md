title: Model Deployment
---

:::important Enterprise Feature
The Model Deployment App is available under the ClearML Enterprise plan.
:::

The Model Deployment application enables users to quickly deploy LLM models as networking services over a secure 
endpoint. This application supports various model configurations and customizations to optimize performance and resource 
usage. The Model Deployment application serves your model on a machine of your choice. Once an app instance is running, 
it serves your model through a secure, publicly accessible network endpoint. The app monitors endpoint activity and 
shuts down if the model remains inactive for a specified maximum idle time.

:::info AI Application Gateway
The Model Deployment app makes use of the ClearML Traffic Router which implements a secure, authenticated 
network endpoint for the model.

If the ClearML AI application Gateway is not available, the model endpoint might not be accessible.
:::

Once you start a Model Deployment instance, you can view the following information in its dashboard:
* Status indicator
  * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-model-active.svg" alt="Active instance" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> - App instance is running and is actively in use
  * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-model-loading.svg" alt="Loading instance" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> - App instance is setting up
  * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-model-idle.svg" alt="Idle instance" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> - App instance is idle
  * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-model-stopped.svg" alt="Stopped instance" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> - App instance is stopped
* Idle time - Time elapsed since last activity 
* Endpoint - The publicly accessible URL of the model endpoint. Active model endpoints are also available in the 
  [Model Endpoints](../webapp_model_endpoints.md) table, which allows you to view and compare endpoint details and 
  monitor status over time
* API base - The base URL for the model endpoint 
* API key - The authentication key for the model endpoint
* Test Command - An example command line to test the deployed model
* Requests - Number of requests over time
* Latency - Request response time (ms) over time
* Endpoint resource monitoring metrics over time
* CPU usage
  * Network throughput
  * Disk performance
  * Memory performance
  * GPU utilization
  * GPU memory usage
  * GPU temperature
* Console log - The console log shows the app instance's console output: setup progress, status changes, error messages,
etc.

## Model Deployment Instance Configuration

When configuring a new Model Deployment instance, you can fill in the required parameters or reuse the 
configuration of a previously launched instance. 

Launch an app instance with the configuration of a previously launched instance using one of the following options:
* Cloning a previously launched app instance will open the instance launch form with the original instance's 
configuration prefilled.
* Importing an app configuration file. You can export the configuration of a previously launched instance as a JSON file 
when viewing its configuration.

The prefilled configuration form can be edited before launching the new app instance.

To configure a new app instance, click `Launch New` <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-add.svg" alt="Add new" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
to open the app's configuration form.

### Configuration Options
* **Import Configuration** - Import an app instance configuration file. This will fill the instance launch form with the 
values from the file, which can be modified before launching the app instance
* **Project name** - ClearML Project Name
* **Task name** - Name of ClearML Task for your Model Deployment app instance
* **Queue** - The [ClearML Queue](../../fundamentals/agents_and_queues.md#what-is-a-queue) to which the Model Deployment app 
instance task will be enqueued (make sure an agent is assigned to that queue)
* **Model** - A ClearML Model ID or a HuggingFace model name (e.g. `openai-community/gpt2`)
* **Model Configuration**
  * Trust Remote Code - Select to set Hugging Face [`trust_remote_code`](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/main/en/reference/launcher#trustremotecode) 
  to `true`.
  * Revision - The specific Hugging Face version of the model (i.e. weights) you want to use. You 
  can use a specific commit ID or a branch like `refs/pr/2`.
  * Code Revision - The specific revision to use for the model code on HuggingFace Hub. It can be a branch name, a tag 
  name, or a commit ID. If unspecified, will use the default version.
  * Max Model Length - Model context length. If unspecified, will be automatically derived from the model
  * Tokenizer - A ClearML Model ID or a Hugging Face tokenizer
  * Tokenizer Revision - The specific tokenizer Hugging Face version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a 
  commit ID. If unspecified, will use the default version.
  * Tokenizer Mode - Select the tokenizer mode:
    * `auto` - Uses the fast tokenizer if available
    * `slow` - Uses the slow tokenizer.
* **LoRA Configuration** 
  * Enable LoRA - If checked, enable handling of [LoRA adapters](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/training/lora#lora).
  * LoRA Modules - LoRA module configurations in the format `name=path`. Multiple modules can be specified.
  * Max LoRAs - Max number of LoRAs in a single batch. 
  * Max LoRA Rank
  * LoRA Extra Vocabulary Size - Maximum size of extra vocabulary that can be present in a LoRA adapter (added to the base model vocabulary).
  * LoRA Dtype - Select the data type for LoRA. Select one of the following:
    * `auto` - If selected, will default to base model data type.
    * `float16`
    * `bfloat16`
    * `float32`    
  * Max CPU LoRAs - Maximum number of LoRAs to store in CPU memory. Must be greater or equal to the 
  `Max Number of Sequences` field in the General section below. Defaults to `Max Number of Sequences`.
* **General**
  * Disable Log Stats - Disable logging statistics
  * Enforce Eager - Always use eager-mode PyTorch. If False, a hybrid of eager mode and CUDA graph will be used for 
  maximal performance and flexibility.
  * Disable Custom All Reduce - See [vllm ParallelConfig](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/vllm/config.py#L701)
  * Disable Logging Requests
  * Fixed API Access Key - Key to use for authenticating API access. Set a fixed API key if you've set up the server to 
  be accessible without authentication. Setting an API key ensures that only authorized users can access the endpoint.
  * HuggingFace Token - Token for accessing HuggingFace models that require authentication
  * Load Format - Select the model weights format to load:
    * `auto` - Load the weights in the safetensors format and fall back to the pytorch bin format if safetensors format is not available. 
    * `pt` - Load the weights in the pytorch bin format. 
    * `safetensors` - Load the weights in the safetensors format. 
    * `npcache` - Load the weights in pytorch format and store a numpy cache to speed up the loading. 
    * `dummy` Initialize the weights with random values. Mainly used for profiling.

    * `bfloat16`
    * `float`
    * `float32`

  * Tensor Parallel Size - Number of tensor parallel replicas
  * Max Parallel Loading Workers - Load model sequentially in multiple batches, to avoid RAM OOM when using tensor 
  parallel and large models

  * Max Number of Sequences - Maximum number of sequences per iteration
  * Max Number of Paddings - Maximum number of paddings in a batch
  * Quantization - Method used to quantize the weights. If None, we first check the `quantization_config` attribute in 
  the model config file. If that is None, we assume the model weights are not quantized and use `dtype` to determine the 
  data type of the weights.
  * Max Context Length to Capture - Maximum context length covered by CUDA graphs. When a sequence has context length 
  larger than this, we fall back to eager mode.
  * Max Log Length - Max number of prompt characters or prompt ID numbers being printed in log. Default: unlimited
