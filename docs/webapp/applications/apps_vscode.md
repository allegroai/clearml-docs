:::important Enterprise Feature
The VS Code application is available under the ClearML Enterprise plan
:::

The VS Code UI application allows you to launch a remote VS Code session on a machine that better meets resource needs. 
This feature provides a local link to access VS Code on a remote machine over a secure and encrypted SSH connection,
letting you use the IDE as if you're running on the target machine itself.

The VS Code session is set up using a [ClearML Agent](../../clearml_agent.md). When configuring an app instance, 
select a queue, and the agent servicing that queue will download and launch the IDE on its machine. When the server 
setup is complete, the dashboard displays a link to access the VS Code session.  

Once you have launched an app instance, you can view the following information in its dashboard: 
* App status indicator
    * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-vscode-loading.svg" alt="VS Code loading" className="icon size-md" /> - Remote IDE is setting up 
    * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-vscode-active.svg" alt="VS Code active" className="icon size-md" /> - Remote IDE is active
    * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-vscode-idle.svg" alt="VS Code idle" className="icon size-md" /> - Remote IDE is idle  
    * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-vscode-stopped.svg" alt="VS Code stopped" className="icon size-md" /> Remote IDE is stopped
* Open IDE - link to the IDE session
* Idle time
* Serverâ€™s resources monitoring (CPU / GPU / vMem utilization)
* Console - The console log shows the instance's activity, including server setup progress, server status changes
