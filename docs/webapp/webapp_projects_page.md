title: Projects Page
---

Use the Projects Page for project navigation and management. 

Your projects are displayed like folders: click a folder to access its contents. The Projects Page shows the top-level 
projects in your workspace. Projects that contain nested subprojects are identified by an extra nested project tab. 
An exception is the **All Experiments** folder, which shows all projects' and subprojects' contents in a single, flat
list.

![Projects page](../img/webapp_project_page.png)

If a project has any subprojects, clicking its folder will open its own project page. Access the projects' top-level 
contents (i.e. experiments, models etc.) via the folder with the bracketed (`[ ]`) project name.

If a project does not contain any subprojects, clicking on its folder will open its experiment table (or [Project Overview](webapp_project_overview.md)
page when relevant).

## Project Folders

Project folders display summarized project information:  

<div class="max-w-50">

![Project card](../img/webapp_project_card.png)

</div>

* When the project contains subprojects, the folder  shows the number of subprojects within the project as an additional 
  tab. Click the tab to view a list of subprojects, and click on a subproject's name to navigate to it.

  <div class="max-w-50">
  
  ![Subproject tab](../img/webapp_sub_project_card.png)

  </div>
  
* When a project's `default_output_destination` is set, the folder displays the <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-info.svg" alt="Info" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
  indicator. Hover over the indicator to view the default output destination.

By default, ClearML infrastructure projects (i.e. dataset, pipeline, reports, application projects) are not shown in the 
projects page. You can enable viewing them in **Settings > Configuration > User Preferences**. When enabled, all infrastructure projects 
are labeled with <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-ghost.svg" alt="Hidden project" className="icon size-md space-sm" />

### Project Actions

Click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-bars-menu.svg" alt="Menu" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> on the top right
of a project folder to open its context menu and access the following project actions:  

![Project context menu](../img/webapp_projects_context_menu.png)

* **Edit** - Rename the project and/or modify its default output destination.
* **New Project** - Create a new project (by default a subproject). 
* **Move to** - Move the project into another project. If the target project does not exist, it is created on-the-fly.
* **Delete** - Delete the project. To delete a project, all of its contents (i.e. any pipelines/reports/datasets) must
first be archived or removed. 

:::important Enterprise Feature
The ClearML Enterprise Server provides a mechanism to define your own custom actions, which will 
appear in the context menu. Create a custom action by defining an HTTP request to issue when clicking on the context menu
action. For more information see [Custom UI Context Menu Actions](../deploying_clearml/clearml_server_config.md#custom-ui-context-menu-actions).

## Create Projects

To create a project, click the **+ NEW PROJECT** button in the top right of the page or in a project's context menu, 
which will open a **New Project** modal. 

![New project modal](../img/webapp_projects_new_project.png)

* Project name
* Create in - Where the project should be created, either as a top-level project (create in `Projects root`) or as a 
  subproject of another project
* Description
* Default output destination - The storage location where model checkpoints (snapshots) and artifacts will be uploaded 
  when tasks in this project that do not have an explicit output destination specified are executed
