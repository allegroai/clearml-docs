title: Windows 10
---

For Windows, launching the pre-built Docker image on a Linux virtual machine is recommended (see [Deploying ClearML Server: Linux or macOS](clearml_server_linux_mac.md)). 
However, ClearML Server can be launched on Windows 10, using Docker Desktop for Windows (see the Docker [System Requirements](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#system-requirements)).

For information about upgrading ClearML Server on Windows, see [here](upgrade_server_win.md).

:::important
If ClearML Server is being reinstalled, clearing browser cookies for ClearML Server is recommended. For example, 
for Firefox, go to Developer Tools > Storage > Cookies, and for Chrome, go to Developer Tools > Application > Cookies,
and delete all cookies under the ClearML Server URL.

## Deploying

:::warning
By default, ClearML Server launches with unrestricted access. To restrict ClearML Server access, follow the instructions in the [Security](clearml_server_security.md) page.
:::

:::info Memory Requirement
Deploying the server requires a minimum of 4 GB of memory, 8 GB is recommended.  
:::

**To deploy ClearML Server on Windows 10:**

1. Install the Docker Desktop for Windows application by either:

    * Following the [Install Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) instructions.
    * Running the Docker installation [wizard](https://hub.docker.com/?overlay=onboarding).

1. Increase the memory allocation in Docker Desktop to `4GB`.

    1. In the Windows notification area (system tray), right click the Docker icon.

    1. Click **Settings** **>** **Advanced**, and then set the memory to at least `4096`.
   
    1. Click **Apply**.
    
1. Remove any previous installation of ClearML Server.

    **This clears all existing ClearML SDK databases.**

        rmdir c:\opt\clearml /s

1. Create local directories for data and logs. Open PowerShell and execute the following commands:

        cd c:
        mkdir c:\opt\clearml\data
        mkdir c:\opt\clearml\logs

1. Save the ClearML Server docker-compose YAML file.
 
        curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allegroai/clearml-server/master/docker/docker-compose-win10.yml -o c:\opt\clearml\docker-compose-win10.yml
 
1. Run `docker-compose`. In PowerShell, execute the following commands:

        docker-compose -f c:\opt\clearml\docker-compose-win10.yml up
   
    The server is now running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
 
## Port Mapping

After deploying ClearML Server, the services expose the following node ports:

* Web server on port `8080`
* API server on port `8008`
* File server on port `8081`

## Restarting

**To restart ClearML Server Docker deployment:**

* Stop and then restart the Docker containers by executing the following commands:

        docker-compose -f c:\opt\clearml\docker-compose-win10.yml down
        docker-compose -f c:\opt\clearml\docker-compose-win10.yml up -d
