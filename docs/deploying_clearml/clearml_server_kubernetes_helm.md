## Prerequisites

* Set up a Kubernetes cluster - For setting up Kubernetes on various platforms refer to the Kubernetes [getting started guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup).
* Set up a single node LOCAL Kubernetes on laptop / desktop - For setting up Kubernetes on your laptop/desktop, [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) is recommended.
* Install `helm` - Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.
To install Helm, refer to the [Helm installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm.html#installing-helm) in the Helm documentation.
Ensure that the `helm` binary is in the PATH of your shell.

## Deployment

You will create a multi-node Kubernetes cluster using Helm, and then install ClearML in your cluster. For deployment 
instructions with up-to-date Helms charts, see the [clearml-helm-charts repository](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/clearml#local-environment).

:::caution Server Access
By default, ClearML Server launches with unrestricted access. To restrict ClearML Server access, follow the 
instructions in the [Security](clearml_server_security.md) page.
