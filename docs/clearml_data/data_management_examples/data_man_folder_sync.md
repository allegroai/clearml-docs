title: Folder Sync with CLI
---

This example shows how to use the `clearml-data` folder sync function.

`clearml-data` folder sync mode is useful for cases when users have a single point of truth (i.e. a folder) that updates 
from time to time. When the point of truth is updated, users can call `clearml-data sync` and the 
changes (file addition, modification, or removal) will be reflected in ClearML.

## Prerequisites
1. First, make sure that you have cloned the [clearml](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml) repository. It contains all
the needed files.

1. Open terminal and change directory to the cloned repository's examples folder
    
   ```
   cd clearml/examples/reporting
   ```

## Syncing a Folder
Create a dataset and sync the `data_samples` folder from the repo to ClearML
```bash
clearml-data sync --project datasets --name sync_folder --folder data_samples
```

Expected response:

```

Dataset closed and finalized
```

As can be seen, the `clearml-data sync` command creates the dataset, then uploads the files, and closes the dataset.


## Modifying Synced Folder

Now we'll modify the folder:
1. Add another line to one of the files in the `data_samples` folder.
1. Add a file to the sample_data folder.<br/> 
   Run`echo "data data data" > data_samples/new_data.txt` (this will create the file `new_data.txt` and put it in the `data_samples` folder)


We'll repeat the process of creating a new dataset with the previous one as its parent, and syncing the folder.

```bash
clearml-data sync --project datasets --name second_ds --parents a1ddc8b0711b4178828f6c6e6e994b7c --folder data_samples
```

Expected response:
```

See that 2 files were added or modified, just as expected!
