:::important Enterprise Feature
Hyper-Datasets are available under the ClearML Enterprise plan
:::

ClearML's Hyper-Datasets are an MLOps-oriented abstraction of your data, which facilitates traceable, reproducible model development
through parameterized data access and meta-data version control. 

The basic premise is that a user-formed query is a full representation of the dataset used by the ML/DL process. 

ClearML **Enterprise**'s Hyper-Datasets supports rapid prototyping, creating new opportunities such as: 
* Hyperparameter optimization of the data itself
* QA/QC pipelining
* CD/CT (continuous training) during deployment
* Enabling complex applications like collaborative (federated) learning.
