Projects are the entities which contain tasks and models. Projects are similar to folders. Users can decide
how to group tasks and models in different projects, though different models or objectives are usually grouped into 
different projects.

Multilevel hierarchy (slash separated path)

Projects can be divided into sub-projects (and sub-sub-projects, etc.) just like files and subdirectories on a 
computer, making experiment organization easier. In the WebApp, every project has an [**Overview**](../webapp/webapp_project_overview.md)
tab, where a project description can be written and shared.

Tasks that are in the system can be accessed and utilized with code. To [access a task](#accessing-tasks), it can be identified either by a 
project name & task name combination or by a unique ID.
