ClearML is an open source MLOPS platform.

It's essentially a toolbox stuffed with everything you'll need to go from experimentation to production:

* There's a fully fledged experiment manager that can log, compare, and automatically reproduce any experiment you do 
* A data versioning tool that can track changes to your datasets and makes them easily accessible to anyone on any machine
* Orchestrate pipelines from code
* Run hyperparameter optimization
* and auto scale remote workers on AWS, GCP and Azure.

Doesn't matter if you're starting small or already in production, there's always a ClearML tool that can make your life easier.

Start for free at app.clear.ml or host your own server from our GitHub page.
