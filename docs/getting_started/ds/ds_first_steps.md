## Install ClearML


First, [sign up for free](https://app.clear.ml)

Install the `clearml` python package:
```bash
pip install clearml
```

## Connect ClearML SDK to the Server 

### Local Python
1. Execute the following command to run the ClearML setup wizard:

   ```bash
   clearml-init
   ```

   If the setup wizard's response indicates that a configuration file already exists, follow the instructions in 
   [here](../../deploying_clearml/clearml_config_for_clearml_server.md#add-clearml-to-a-configuration-file). The wizard 
   does not edit or overwrite existing configuration files.

1. The setup wizard prompts for ClearML credentials.

   ```console
   Please create new clearml credentials through the settings page in your `clearml-server` web app, 
   or create a free account at https://app.clear.ml/settings/webapp-configuration
    
   In the settings > workspace  page, press "Create new credentials", then press "Copy to clipboard".
   Paste copied configuration here: 
   ```
      
1. Get ClearML credentials. Open the ClearML Web UI in a browser. On the [**SETTINGS > WORKSPACE**](https://app.clear.ml/settings/workspace-configuration) 
   page, click **Create new credentials**.
   
   The **LOCAL PYTHON** tab shows the data required by the setup wizard (a copy to clipboard action is available on 
   hover)
    
1. At the command prompt `Paste copied configuration here:`, copy and paste the ClearML credentials.
   The setup wizard confirms the credentials. 
   ```console
   Detected credentials key="********************" secret="*******"
   ```
   
1. Enter the ClearML Server web server URL, or press **Enter** to accept the default which is detected from the 
   credentials.
   
   ```console 
   WEB Host configured to: [https://app.<your-domain>] 
   ```
    
1. Enter the ClearML Server API server URL, or press **Enter** to accept the default value which is based on the previous response:
   ```console 
   API Host configured to: [https://api.<your-domain>] 
   ```
   
1. Enter the ClearML Server file server URL, or press **Enter** to accept the default value which is based on the previous response:
   ```console
   File Store Host configured to: [files.<your-domain>] 
   ``` 
   
   The wizard responds with a configuration and directs to the ClearML Server.
   ```console 
   CLEARML Hosts configuration:
   Web App: https://app.<your-domain>
   API: https://api.<your-domain>
   File Store: https://files.<your-domain>
            
   Verifying credentials ...
   Credentials verified!
    
   New configuration stored in /home/<username>/clearml.conf
   CLEARML setup completed successfully.
   ```
   
Now you can integrate ClearML into your code! Continue [here](#auto-log-experiment).

### Jupyter Notebook
To use ClearML with Jupyter Notebook, you need to configure ClearML Server access credentials for your notebook.

1. Get ClearML credentials. Open the ClearML Web UI in a browser. On the [**SETTINGS > WORKSPACE**](https://app.clear.ml/settings/workspace-configuration) 
   page, click **Create new credentials**. The **JUPYTER NOTEBOOK** tab shows the commands required to configure your 
   notebook (a copy to clipboard action is available on hover)
1. Add these commands to your notebook

Now you can use ClearML in your notebook!

## Auto-log Experiment

In ClearML, experiments are organized as [Tasks](../../fundamentals/task.md).

ClearML will automatically log your experiment and code, including outputs and parameters from popular ML frameworks,
once you integrate the ClearML [SDK](../../clearml_sdk/clearml_sdk.md) with your code. To control what ClearML automatically logs, see this [FAQ](../../faq.md#controlling_logging).

At the beginning of your code, import the `clearml` package:

```python
from clearml import Task
```

:::note Full Automatic Logging
To ensure full automatic logging, it is recommended to import the `clearml` package at the top of your entry script.
:::

Then initialize the Task object in your `main()` function, or the beginning of the script.

```python
task = Task.init(project_name='great project', task_name='best experiment')
```

If the project does not already exist, a new one will be created automatically.

The console should return the following output:

```
ClearML Task: created new task id=1ca59ef1f86d44bd81cb517d529d9e5a
2021-07-25 13:59:09
ClearML results page: https://app.clear.ml/projects/4043a1657f374e9298649c6ba72ad233/experiments/1ca59ef1f86d44bd81cb517d529d9e5a/output/log
2021-07-25 13:59:16
```

**That’s it!** You are done integrating ClearML with your code :)

Now, [command-line arguments](../../fundamentals/hyperparameters.md#tracking-hyperparameters), [console output](../../fundamentals/logger.md#types-of-logged-results) as well as Tensorboard and Matplotlib will automatically be logged in the UI under the created Task.
