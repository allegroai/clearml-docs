## What Can You Do with ClearML?

- [Track and upload](../fundamentals/task.md) metrics and models with only 2 lines of code
- [Reproduce](../webapp/webapp_exp_reproducing.md) experiments with 3 mouse clicks
- [Create bots](../guides/services/slack_alerts.md) that send you Slack messages based on experiment behavior (for example,
alert you whenever your model improves in accuracy)
- Manage your [data](../clearml_data/clearml_data.md) - store, track, and version control 
- Remotely execute experiments on any compute resource you have available with [ClearML Agent](../clearml_agent.md)  
- Automatically scale cloud instances according to your resource needs with ClearML's [GPU Compute](../webapp/applications/apps_gpu_compute.md), 
[AWS Autoscaler](../webapp/applications/apps_aws_autoscaler.md), and [GCP Autoscaler](../webapp/applications/apps_gcp_autoscaler.md)
GUI applications
- Run [hyperparameter optimization](../fundamentals/hpo.md) 
- Build [pipelines](../pipelines/pipelines.md) from code 
- Much more!
