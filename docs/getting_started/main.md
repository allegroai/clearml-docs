## What Can You Do with ClearML?

- Manage your experiments:
  - [Track and upload](../fundamentals/task.md) all of your code configuration and outputs--parameters, models, metrics, and more--with only 2 lines of code
  - [Reproduce](../webapp/webapp_exp_reproducing.md) experiments with 3 mouse clicks
  - [Compare](../webapp/webapp_exp_comparing.md) experiment setups and results
- [Create a bot](../guides/services/slack_alerts.md) that sends you a Slack message whenever your model improves in accuracy
- Store, track, and version control your [data](../clearml_data/clearml_data.md)
- Remotely execute experiments on any compute resource you have available with [ClearML Agent](../clearml_agent.md)  
- Automatically scale cloud instances according to your resource needs with ClearML's [GPU Compute](../webapp/applications/apps_gpu_compute.md), 
[AWS Autoscaler](../webapp/applications/apps_aws_autoscaler.md), and [GCP Autoscaler](../webapp/applications/apps_gcp_autoscaler.md)
GUI applications
- Run [hyperparameter optimization](../fundamentals/hpo.md) 
- Orchestrate [pipelines](../pipelines/pipelines.md) from code 
- Much more!
