ClearML is an open source platform that automates and simplifies developing and managing machine learning solutions
 for thousands of data science teams all over the world.
It is designed as an end-to-end MLOps suite allowing you to focus on developing your ML code & automation,
while ClearML ensures your work is reproducible and scalable.

## What Can You Do with ClearML?

- [Track and upload](../fundamentals/task.md) metrics and models with only 2 lines of code
- [Reproduce](../webapp/webapp_exp_reproducing.md) experiments with 3 mouse clicks
- [Create bots](../guides/services/slack_alerts.md) that send you Slack messages based on experiment behavior (for example,
alert you whenever your model improves in accuracy)
- Manage your [data](../clearml_data/clearml_data.md) - store, track, and version control 
- Remotely execute experiments on any compute resource you have available with [ClearML Agent](../clearml_agent.md)  
- Automatically scale cloud instances according to your resource needs with ClearML's [GPU Compute](../webapp/applications/apps_gpu_compute.md), 
[AWS Autoscaler](../webapp/applications/apps_aws_autoscaler.md), and [GCP Autoscaler](../webapp/applications/apps_gcp_autoscaler.md)
GUI applications
- Run [hyperparameter optimization](../fundamentals/hpo.md) 
- Build [pipelines](../pipelines/pipelines.md) from code 
- Much more!
