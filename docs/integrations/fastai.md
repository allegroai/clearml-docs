If you are not already using ClearML, see [Getting Started](../getting_started/ds/ds_first_steps.md) for setup 
instructions.

ClearML integrates seamlessly with [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/), automatically logging its models and scalars. 

All you have to do is simply add two lines of code to your `fastai` script:

```python
from clearml import Task
task = Task.init(task_name="<task_name>", project_name="<project_name>")
```

And that’s it! This creates a [ClearML Task](../fundamentals/task.md) which captures: 
* Source code and uncommitted changes
* Installed packages
* `fastai` model files 
* Scalars (loss, learning rates)
* Console output
* General details such as machine details, runtime, creation date etc.
* Hyperparameters created with standard python packages (e.g. argparse, click, Python Fire, etc.)
* And more

You can view all the task details in the [WebApp](../webapp/webapp_overview.md). 

See an example of `fastai` and ClearML in action [here](../guides/frameworks/fastai/fastai_with_tensorboard.md).

## Automatic Logging Control 
By default, when ClearML is integrated into your `fastai` script, it captures models and 
scalars. But, you may want to have more control over what your experiment logs.

To control a task's framework logging, use the `auto_connect_frameworks` parameter of [`Task.init()`](../references/sdk/task.md#taskinit). 
Completely disable all automatic logging by setting the parameter to `False`. For finer grained control of logged 
frameworks, input a dictionary, with framework-boolean pairs.

For example:

```python
auto_connect_frameworks={
   'fastai': False, 'catboost': True, 'tensorflow': False, 'tensorboard': False, 'pytorch': True,
   'xgboost': False, 'scikit': True,  'lightgbm': False,
   'hydra': True, 'detect_repository': True, 'tfdefines': True, 'joblib': True,
   'megengine': True, 'jsonargparse': True
}
```

You can also input wildcards as dictionary values, so ClearML will log a model created by a framework only if its local 
path matches at least one wildcard. 

For example, in the code below, ClearML will log `fastai` models only if their paths have the `.pth` extension. The 
unspecified frameworks' values default to true so all their models are automatically logged.

```python
auto_connect_frameworks={'fastai' : '*.pth'}
```

## Manual Logging
To augment its automatic logging, ClearML also provides an explicit logging interface.

See more information about explicitly logging information to a ClearML Task:
* [Models](../clearml_sdk/model_sdk.md#manually-logging-models)
* [Configuration](../clearml_sdk/task_sdk.md#configuration) (e.g. parameters, configuration files)
* [Artifacts](../clearml_sdk/task_sdk.md#artifacts) (e.g. output files or python objects created by a task)
* [Scalars](../clearml_sdk/task_sdk.md#scalars) 
* [Text/Plots/Debug Samples](../fundamentals/logger.md#manual-reporting)

See [Explicit Reporting Tutorial](../guides/reporting/explicit_reporting.md).

## Remote Execution
ClearML logs all the information required to reproduce an experiment on a different machine (installed packages, 
uncommitted changes etc.). The [ClearML Agent](../clearml_agent) listens to designated queues and when a task is enqueued, 
the agent pulls it, recreates its execution environment, and runs it, reporting its scalars, plots, etc. to the 
experiment manager.

Deploy a ClearML Agent onto any machine (e.g. a cloud VM, a local GPU machine, your own laptop) by simply running the 
following command on it:

```commandline
clearml-agent daemon --queue <queues_to_listen_to> [--docker]
```

Use the ClearML [Autoscalers](../cloud_autoscaling/autoscaling_overview.md), to help you manage cloud workloads in the 
cloud of your choice (AWS, GCP, Azure) and automatically deploy ClearML agents: the autoscaler automatically spins up 
and shuts down instances as needed, according to a resource budget that you set.

### Cloning, Editing, and Enqueuing

![Cloning, editing, enqueuing gif](../img/gif/integrations_yolov5.gif)

Use ClearML's web interface to edit task details, like configuration parameters or input models, then execute the task 
with the new configuration on a remote machine:

* Clone the experiment
* Edit the hyperparameters and/or other details
* Enqueue the task

The ClearML Agent executing the task will use the new values to [override any hard coded values](../clearml_agent).

### Executing a Task Remotely

You can set a task to be executed remotely programmatically by adding [`Task.execute_remotely()`](../references/sdk/task.md#execute_remotely) 
to your script. This method stops the current local execution of the task, and then enqueues it to a specified queue to 
re-run it on a remote machine.

```python
# If executed locally, process will terminate, and a copy will be executed by an agent instead
task.execute_remotely(queue_name='default', exit_process=True)
```
